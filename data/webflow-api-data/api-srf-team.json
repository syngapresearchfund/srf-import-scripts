We spent about a year doing various tests and consulting with neurologists in South Africa trying to determine the cause of his developmental delay. When seizures become apparent at 14 months, we were referred to a geneticist who ran Invitae's epilepsy panel for us. This revealed a pathogenic mutation on his SynGAP1 gene and we had an answer for all of the symptoms we observed. As a family, we are dedicated to doing our best to care for Emmitt while also helping to build the SynGAP1 community as a whole.</p>",
