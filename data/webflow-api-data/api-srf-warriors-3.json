			"full-story": "<p>Jackson was diagnosed in December of 2021. Prior to SYNGAP1 diagnosis he was not diagnosed with Epilepsy, his Epilepsy diagnosis was confirmed January 2022. <br></p><p>Jackson is 6 years old. He spent the first 3 years of life living by the beach in sunny Fort Lauderdale, Florida. We now live in Canton, Georgia. </p><p>Jackson is a funny, smart and energetic little man. He loves to swim, go for boat and golf cart rides. He is our little dare devil, he loves to ride rollercoasters, water slides and drive fast cars. When Jackson is home he loves to listen to music, watch movies, wrestle with his Dad and flip through his favorite books. Jackson is blessed to have a strong support system surrounded by grandparents, family and friends that love him and have been part of his journey since the beginning. Like most Syngapian children, Jackson has significant daily struggles with communication, sleep, feeding, behavior and digestive issues. Having a personalized support system from providers at Fusion Autism Center of Canton, Path 2 Progress Speech and Dr. Peter Scire (Functional Neurologist) have been instrumental in helping Jackson overcome his challenges. Over the years his team of doctors and therapists have become like family and understand Jackson's unique characteristics. Knowing Jackson has Syngap hasn’t changed the way we look at our son, but it has brought into focus the parts of him that were never fully clear and allows us to pray for a future filled with scientific advancements and raising awareness. <br></p>",

He loves playing with his friends at school, swimming, cycling, riding tractor with his grandfather to the fields, fighting with his brother and watching videos on youtube.</p><p>As his family, we noticed that Ihsan had some developmental problems at the age of 2. We struggled for a long time to find out what the problem was, meeting many doctors, psychologists and child development experts, but could not find a clear answer. Some disorders were detected in Ihsan's EEG, but he was not diagnosed with epilepsy because he had no seizures.</p><p>Ihsan has taken many therapies to overcome general developmental problems, these threpies include such as special education, sensory integration therapy, speech therapy, social presence and sports training. And he benefited from all these activities and his development continued. We saw that children like Ihsan develop when they get the right treatments,&nbsp; So, it is very important for our children to continue right threpies without getting tired.&nbsp;</p><p>Although it is a bit difficult to understand, Ihsan can speak, read and write, and makes an effort to learn simple mathematics. A few years ago, we thought it was impossible for her to do these things but he did. Ihsan is very happy to be in social environments and wants to participate and be accepted. We hope Ihsan will have a life of his own in the future, and hope that he will achieve this with new medicines and treatment methods.</p><p>As his parents, we learned a lot from Ihsan, to accept and struggle patiently. We also had new family friends that their children also have developmental problems such as autism. We contribute to the development of our children by sharing our experiences together.<br></p>",

			"name": "Mya ",
			"location": "Ontario, Canada ",
			"full-story": "<p>Mya is a silly, fun, loveable girl who loves her little sister Ayla (aka “Eyes” as she likes to call her). Mya loves to be outside no matter the weather. She enjoys swimming, music, animals, spending time with her family, reading books and her dance class that she attends weekly. But most of all she loves to sweep and clean the house. Mya has come a long way in her 3 years. We noticed early on that she was not hitting the typical milestones most kids were at her age such as crawling, walking or talking. Mya didn’t start crawling until she was over 1 year old and walking at 2 years old. At 1 year old, we started a private physiotherapy as we were on a wait list for Ron Joyce and wanted to help her the best we can as soon as possible. Soon after we were on a wait list for speech as well, which we also went privately since COVID prolonged our waiting period. It wasn’t until this year, Mya got into Ron Joyce Centre for speech, physio and occupational therapy. Originallywe were told that she may be behind with her gross motor skills due to having \"hyper mobility\". After several tests, including genetic testing, in September 2021, Mya was diagnosed with SYNGAP1. As parents we always thought maybe Mya was just developmentally delayed, but this clarified that that was not the case. With this information we were told that she will most likely develop Epilepsy as well. At the time we didn’t think this was something we needed to worry about, but with plenty of networking with other parents, researching and observing, we got Mya retested and she was diagnosed with Epilepsy in November 2021. Mya continues to work hard everyday trying to tell us her wants and needs and pushing her physical limits to the best of her abilities. Mya loves going to daycare two times a week as she is pretty social. Mya has difficulty sleeping, and is often awake at 1:30am for the day which makes it difficult to get through the day. This is common with SYNGAPIANS. We are hoping one day she will be able to sleep through the night. Mya has a hard time keeping up with her peers. She is still working on her balance with going up and down stairs, as well as hopping and jumping. Mya will continue to work hard on these skills and I’m sure one day will be able to do so. Mya’s smile can light up a room, and she loves when people cheer her on, including herself! Mya is very proud of herself when she accomplishes anything, and always celebrates with a “yayy!!” as she claps her hands. She loves and takes pride in identifying colours, letters, and counting to 10. We are so proud of our little girl and everything she has already overcome in her short 3 years.</p><p>We continue to hope for the best for her and looking forward to watching her grow.</p><p><br></p><p>‍</p>",

They have told us on several occasions that he transmits a special light.</p><p>After a long study to find out what the final diagnosis would be, in January 2021, he was diagnosed with Syngap1,</p><p>At six months we began to notice delays in developmental milestones, as a result of that a psychomotor and language delay for which he underwent a series of blood tests; one of them being the one that alarmed us. At the same time, he began to have problems with hypotonia and hypermobility, so his neurologist indicated a genetic panel of neuromuscular diseases which did not show any pathology and then admitted him to the Telethon. Then he had a great advance, managing to walk at the age of two years, four months, a moment that was very important and emotional for us.</p><p>But our happiness would not last long since after a month of walking, he began to have seizures of just seconds of absence and then shaking of the head especially when he was eating. He also suddenly falls; a moment of onset of Epilepsy. To prevent strong blows, his helmet accompanied him for a few months, until we managed to control his epileptic seizures where it has remained without seizures to this day. Later they indicated that a genetic panel of epilepsies be carried out, resulting in this condition.</p><p>He also has an ataxia, he doesn't speak yet, but he says and reads some vowels, language is the biggest challenge. His autism traits. Until recently he began to have some behavioural problems, but in general he is a very affectionate and funny child. He is a little boy making people laugh with his crazy things. However, he still has his character and is very alert and intelligent.</p><p>He loves water, animals especially the dog, he got a dog companion from his aunt who sometimes plays with him, called Loki, he encouraged him and helped him a lot to walk. He also likes to play the piano, he does it with feeling, he likes music a lot, he has a good ear for it, he is mesmerized by classical music.</p><p>He is our brave little warrior who we love with all our soul, who has taught us a lot about the value of perseverance and to be stronger, especially in the search to give him the best tools for his development and continue this fight to improve his quality of life. Their names have meanings; Rafael: The one that God has healed and Arturo: Strong as a bear, we do not lose hope.</p>",

We started noticing he was not able to sit, roll or eat baby foods. He was evaluated at 9 months by the school district and started receiving services along with professional therapies in PT, OT and Speech. Trace started sitting at 12 months, crawling at 18 months followed by walking at 2 years 3 months. We continued to search for answers and met with a neurologist along with genetics where he was given a Chromosomal Microarray testing. Results came back with no answers and a continued diagnosis of Developmentally delayed. Finally, after going through Whole Exome Sequencing we found Trace had Syngap1. </p><p>Today, Trace has started a preschool program and continues to thrive and meet milestones. We are so proud of his accomplishments this far and celebrate the littlest things on a daily basis. He is the little boy that will grab anyone’s hands to take you on his journey, provide you with a snuggles, make you smile ear to ear and laugh with his contagious giggles. Trace is the happiest when he is outside, “driving” the car, checking o tires, chasing bubbles, singing songs,reading books and most of all “swimming” in the bath tub.</p><p>We have so much hope for our little man and finding treatments for Syngap1</p>",

			"name": "Beckett",
			"location": "Idaho",
			"full-story": "<p>Beckett was diagnosed with SynGAP1 at the beginning of June 2020. Concerns for Beckett began when he was an infant. At the age of 2 months old he was referred to GI for infrequent bowel movements, who noted concerns with his breathing while breastfeeding. A referral to an ENT confirmed that he had laryngomalacia. He underwent airway surgery at 6 months of age to correct his floppy airway. While I was assured that he would grow out of his issues, he always struggled with feeding. When he was 10 months old, he stopped taking a bottle and was listed as failure to thrive. Eight months later, he was struggling to maintain weight and stopped growing. A G-tube was placed to aid in him receiving nutrition. Referral to neurology was sent over at 12 months because he had an asymmetrical crawl and as a parent, I was concerned that there was something more going on. Neurology completed an MRI, which was normal and indicated that they felt he would grow out of it. This was not the case. Beckett began to randomly fall backwards and hit his head when seated. A 30-minute EEG let us know that he was at risk for seizures, but no seizures were identified at that time. By the time he was 19 months old several seizure types were noted. He would pause in play, eyelids rolling up that were attached to stimulus (feeding, sound, touch), and drop seizures appeared just as he was beginning to walk. He received a diagnosis of atypical absence seizures in May 2020. By this time, he was having visible seizures every 30 minutes throughout the day. Genetic testing was offered to see if we could identify a cause behind the seizures. Diagnosis of global developmental delay and ASD followed. Looking back, a lot of his issues we experienced were related to SynGAP1. Constipation, feeding difficulties, epilepsy, motor delay, and hypotonia are all symptoms associated with SynGAP1 that we had identified early on. Beckett receives PT, OT, ST, and music therapy weekly. He attends a developmental preschool and while he no longer receives feeding therapy, he still refuses to drink water from a cup. <br></p><p>Beckett has brought a lot of joy to our lives. He loves music and any activity outside. He loves swimming, camping, riding the UTV, and going fast. He runs over to any vehicle the second you start it (UTV, dirt bike, power wheels, truck) and is ready to go. His major obsession currently is “getting gas” and labeling the colors of the traffic lights as they change. He communicates in 1–3-word sentences and will imitate words that are modeled. He recently began jumping and does it frequently throughout his day. His gross motor skills are improving, he can run and can climb small, slanted rock walls without help. He has the best laugh and gives the best hugs where he melts into you. <br></p><p>Our biggest challenge is keeping seizures in control. Our neurologist has informed us that Beckett will not be seizure free. With medication adjustments we have gotten him down to 3-5 short absence seizures daily, but it always seems short lived and then we must start adjusting his medication again. Beckett’s receptive language delay inhibits him from understanding what we are communicating, and it often causes him to become very upset. An example is when he wants to go outside but needs shoes on first. He often will scream and get upset because he needs to put shoes on first thinking you are not going to let him go outside. Anxiety is another challenge we encounter daily. He triggers into fight or flight mode from simple things, like the footrest elevating on a recliner. Sleep has been an issue since he was little. He will wake in the middle of the night (2-3 am) laughing, talking, or sliding his fingers along his crib rails. Getting him back to sleep takes several hours, if accomplished. <br></p><p>While the diagnosis of SynGAP1 provided us with an answer, it also left us with a lot of uncertainty about the future and what we can do to provide him with the best possible outcome. The SynGAP1 community is invaluable. They have answered questions, provided us with access to researchers and knowledge about the disease, and are fighting to get our children access to treatment to better their future. &nbsp;</p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Santino was born on December 20th, 2011, in Córdoba, Argentina. His development during the first year was normal, he only had lactose intolerance and some strange movements in his hands. When he was one, we noticed differences compared to other children around the same age, he did not talk, he did not walk and made several unusual movements with his hands and arms. We started with a neurologist and after a year and a half he was diagnosed with speech and global developmental delay, he also started his therapies and daycare. At the age of two he began to walk. In two opportunities he began talking and later he would stop doing it. At 4 years, his diagnosis changed to General Developmental Disorder, unspecified. He continued with his rehabilitation, always achieving important goals. He started school with Waldorf pedagogy and his inclusive teacher. He has never lost his joy and his desire to work. At the same time we made many visits with different medical specialists and alternative treatments and two years ago, various genetic studies. In February of 2021 they gave us his Syngap1 diagnosis. He does not take medication and does not have epilepsy. We start another path again with a lot of uncertainty but with the peace of mind of really knowing what his illness is. He is currently going to 4th grade, he goes to speech therapy, occupational therapy, kinesiology and he has a therapeutic helper. He loves water, music, technology, riding a bike and walking. He communicates through a tablet with a special program and nowadays he is interested in playing with his sister Catalina and his friends. This is briefly a summary of his life ... Thank you for joining us on this path.</p><p>Florence and Luciano</p><p><br><br></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Hattie was diagnosed with SYNGAP1 in May 2021. &nbsp;Since she was a baby, Hattie struggled to meet her mile-stones, and we started working with therapists at 13 months. &nbsp;Specialists diagnosed Hattie with global developmental delay at age 2, and deemed that she did not fall on the autism spectrum because of her desire to be social and the eye contact she would make (a common misconception). &nbsp;By the time Hattie was 4, we were not convinced that this was the case. A friend encouraged us to seek a second opinion from a child psychologist, and Hattie was diagnosed with ASD in December 2020. &nbsp;We decided to take things a step further, and elected to get full exome sequencing because the limited panel of genetic testing that her doctors gave her came back normal. &nbsp;Soon after receiving her SYNGAP diagnosis, her epilepsy diagnosis shortly followed. &nbsp;Hattie was having countless absence seizures daily that we were not picking up on because they would be as unnoticeable as quick eye blinks or briefly staring into space. &nbsp;Doctors told us these episodes were related to her motor processing delays, but therapists at school continued to make us aware of these spells. &nbsp;Hattie also struggles with nightly sleep disturbances that we were told were because of the manner in which she falls asleep (with mom in her room), but we now know she is likely having seizures in her sleep. &nbsp;Epilepsy was confirmed with an EEG on her 5th birthday. &nbsp;</p><p>Hattie adores puppies, jumping on the trampoline with her brothers, and spending countless hours watching Moana. &nbsp;She lights up a room with her sunny disposition, and is extremely mellow (especially compared to her rambunctious brothers). She is able to communicate her needs to us in 2-4 word phrases, and continues to expand her vocabulary through speech therapy. &nbsp;She is working to learn to use eating utensils, and we are currently working on teaching her to ride a bike with training wheels. &nbsp;Hattie goes to a therapeutic preschool that we believe has changed the trajectory of her development. The ABA therapy she receives there has been paramount. &nbsp;They have her almost potty trained, and are working on teaching her social skills.</p><p>Receiving Hattie’s SYNGAP diagnosis was an unbelievable relief for us. &nbsp;It not only answered so many questions, but we were welcomed into the most warm and loving community of other families. &nbsp;While there are not any other known Syngapians here in Kansas City, we have been able to connect with other families while on vacation. &nbsp;The feeling of meeting others like our Hattie has made us feel that we are not alone in this very special journey. We are so hopeful and encouraged that with awareness, research, and all the incredible advances in science and technology that we will find a cure. &nbsp; </p>",

			"location": "Atlanta, Georgia ",
			"full-story": "<p>Jansen's journey began 11 years ago in October 2010 when she came into the world a few weeks early in our hometown of Atlanta, GA. &nbsp;Jansen was a typical baby, although she appeared to feed often without gaining weight. &nbsp;We attributed this to Mom’s insufficient milk supply, so pumped into bottles and added formula supplements. &nbsp;That did the trick, but we now realize that Mom’s milk wasn’t the issue -- Jansen’s oral muscles just weren’t strong enough for her to breastfeed. &nbsp;</p><p>When Jansen was 4 months old, we noticed that she preferred to curl into a ball rather than stretch out and use her legs. &nbsp;She never stood or bounced on our laps like many infants, so we visited a physical therapist at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. &nbsp;Shortly thereafter, at 5 months of age, Jansen was diagnosed with global developmental delay, hypotonia (low muscle tone), and an inability to bear weight on her extremities. &nbsp;This diagnosis caught us off guard, but we quickly enrolled Jansen in physical therapy and applied to Babies Can’t Wait for early intervention services. &nbsp;As Jansen grew into a toddler, we added more therapies and became increasingly worried about Jansen’s lack of babbling and pronouncement of her first words. We registered Jansen in special needs programs at preschools and searched the country for answers. &nbsp;When Jansen was age 3, we first submitted her DNA for genetic testing. &nbsp;Results were inconclusive. &nbsp;</p><p>At 5 years of age, Jansen started having infrequent and fleeting staring episodes. &nbsp;So, back to testing we went. &nbsp;Jansen was diagnosed with Absence Epilepsy at age 5 ½. &nbsp;Still, doctors remained befuddled by Jansen’s growing list of complications. &nbsp;Fast forward five years. &nbsp;Among other symptoms, Jansen now suffers from epilepsy, a severe intellectual disability, speech and language difficulties (she speaks in 3-4-word phrases), low muscle tone (hypotonia), general fatigue, sleep problems, gait abnormalities, coordination &amp; motor skill issues, eye problems, growth decline, high pain tolerance, and behavioral concerns. </p><p> We never gave up searching for answers, despite being told to do so. &nbsp;As our anxiety ratcheted up over the years, and our dreams faded, we simply worked to provide Jansen with the best life we could. &nbsp;Easier said than done when facing the unknown! &nbsp;But, on Dad’s birthday in September 2021, our desperate wish for clarity came true. &nbsp;Despite having already completed extensive genetic testing (including 3 rounds of Whole Exome Sequencing), Whole Genome Analysis finally solved our mystery. &nbsp;The underlying cause of Jansen's struggles is SYNGAP1.</p><p>Jansen is an adrenaline junkie – the faster, the better! &nbsp;She adores all animals, especially horses whom she rides through therapeutic horseback riding. &nbsp;Swimming, playing special needs baseball, working puzzles and sticker mosaics, and adaptive skiing are highlights for her. &nbsp;Our pride in Jansen’s accomplishments, such as riding a bike and daytime potty training, is immense – Jansen truly makes us appreciate milestones in life that, to some, are a given. &nbsp;</p><p>Jansen does not particularly enjoy school – it’s tiring and challenging for her. &nbsp;But she does like socializing and benefits from working on reading, writing, and math. &nbsp;She also enjoys games on the iPad more than we’d like!&nbsp;Jansen plays with all forms of toy vehicles (cars, trucks, planes, and more), loves dressing up in costumes, and has fun building Legos. &nbsp;Jansen’s older brothers, Wyatt and Porter, are usually quite solicitous of her. &nbsp;While she can frustrate them, watching our teenage sons act protectively and do their best to manage Jansen’s outbursts is heartwarming. &nbsp;We are especially grateful to them, since Jansen has “fired” many babysitters. &nbsp;Jansen is sweet and cuddly, but can act out (spit, bite, growl, throw things, etc.) when she doesn’t get her way. &nbsp;It has been astonishing to learn that these behaviors, as well as fearlessness, high pain tolerance, and delight in all things water are indicative of SYNGAP1 children. &nbsp;</p><p>We are tremendously grateful to have found answers for our Janey Bear. &nbsp;We see the very real possibility of a CURE and believe that, together, we can make a difference in the life of Jansen and other Syngapians.</p><p> - Suzanne and Brent Jones</p><p>‍</p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Brenden was diagnosed with syngap1 back in 2019. Brenden has epilepsy. By the age of 1 we noticed that Brenden had delays. He wasn't crawling or showing signs and wasn't trying to talk. By 1.5 yrs old we were into therapy OT, Physiotherapy and Speech. A few weeks after his 2nd Birthday we noticed his first seizure. A couple weeks after Brenden began to walk with a walking aid. To this day Brenden is walking with AFOs. Brenden is doing amazing with matching colors and shapes on a tablet but to do it without a tablet is a struggle. Brenden loves painting at school and loves to be around his friends from his class Brenden loves the outdoors. If he could stay outside all day everyday he would. He loves playing in water as well as LOVES slides. If there is a slide around thats where you will find him. Some challenges he faces are behaviour and frustration. He also struggles feeding himself but is trying to figure a fork and spoon. Brenden has accomplished being to sign 'more / help /all done' and recognizing some animals and making some sounds and flapping arms for birds</p><p>‍</p>",

When she was 5 months old we noticed that she had low muscle tone and was not trying to setup. For a year we tried to correct the situations using rehabilitations and nootropics but no luck. As time went our daughter had more motor and intellectual delays. Then she was diagnosed with epilepsy. <br></p><p>We got the diagnosis SYNGAP1 in August 2019 when Teona was 2 years old. The diagnosis was a big shock for our family. What scares us that there is no medicine that can help us, but we do not lose hope, we are constantly studying and trying to find the right thing for our daughter. We really hope for a miracle! We are thankful to SRF and their extensive research on a possible treatment for SynGAP1 someday. <br></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Arvo was born as our second child, two years and two months after his older brother. The first developmental milestones Arvo reached \"in time\", but around ten months we started to notice that his motor skills weren't advancing. He also wasn't much interested in toys, which we found a bit unusual. At 2 years 3 months he started to experience noticeable seizures and was consequently diagnosed with epilepsy in January 2020. After getting the medication for epilepsy on track and having a long series of medical tests done we got the diagnosis of Syngap1 in January 2021. </p><p>Arvo loves to listen to adults reading or singing, and to look at picture books on his own too. He enjoys long showers and climbing, especially on stairs. He is also an eager walker, but due to significant difficulties in sensory processing his sense of balance is affected, which makes it hard for him to learn to walk without support. Other sensory issues include being very sensitive to sudden, loud or unfamiliar noises, having an overly sensitive sense of touch in his hands and feet, but being slightly unsensitive to pain. </p><p>Arvo is non-verbal, but understands a lot of what's being said, and is able to read situations pretty well and navigate in them accordingly. Arvo is also a very determined little boy, exploring the world as best as he is able, and communicating his feelings and needs with smiles, crying and pointing at things. He has his own sense of humor and loves to play and have a laugh, especially with his brother. With his brave spirit and ready smiles Arvo is a great favorite among his caretakers and outside the family too. </p><p>We hope that with the help of therapies and medical advances he will continue to thrive, learn new skills and be an active and happy individual throughout his life.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>‍</p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Avery was recently diagnosed with Syngap1 in March 2021. Avery is such a joyful little boy. He loves water, flags, umbrellas, playing outside especially being on the swing, and jumping on the trampoline. He is very playful and brings such a great energy to our lives. Once you meet Avery, you fall in love instantly. We first started noticing Avery’s slower development around 10-12 months when he was struggling to stand and he wasn’t able to walk alone till 18 months. Communication also became an issue. He also had a lip tie which led us to believe that was the issue with his communication and feeding problems. He would babble some but very little. We immediately reached out for support and was able to get him in to OT, PT, Speech and feeding therapy. It wasn’t until this year however that we were finally able to get a diagnosis. Most recently, we met with a neurologist team at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital in July to take steps to see if Avery has been having seizures and to find out the next steps. They have scheduled him a EEG for August. We are very hopeful for the future and whats to come for Avery. We know that as of right now there is no possible cure but with our continued &nbsp;treatment plan of therapies we will only see improvements. The best advice we can give &nbsp;to newly diagnosed patients and their families is to seek therapy quickly and look for support groups. Having a support system behind you is very important.</p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Jordan is the youngest of 3 boys. Aaron is 19 and Ryan is 11. When Jordan was born in December 2017 in Ireland everything seemed perfect. He weighed 7 pounds 8 1/2 ounces. As time went on he wasn’t meeting his milestones. Jordan only crawled at 1 learning to walk was very difficult for him as his balance was very poor. He eventually started walking at 2, he regularly fell due to poor balance and then eye flickering became a frequent occurrence. Jordan was unable to feed himself with a spoon as he has poor motor skills but he tried so so hard. Myself and my husband John we’re not happy with Jordan’s eye flickering then followed by drop seizures so we then brought him to the emergency department. Jordan got a CT scan and an MRI scan which both came back normal, so an EEG was next. May 2021, Jordan was diagnosed with epilepsy. That same day, blood work was completed for genetic testing. July 7th 2021, he was given the SynGAP1 diagnosis. Jordan loves to listen to music and loves to play with water. He is very socialable even though he is non verbal he loves to greet people by touching their hand. We are so very proud of our Warrior and how far he has come! <br></p><p>‍</p>",

We thought it was nothing terrible, a bit of physical therapy and it would be ok, but time passed and our daughter had more and more motor and intellectual delays, in the meantime she was diagnosed with epilepsy. We received the SYNGAP1 diagnosis in May 2021 when Julia was 2.5 years old. We learned that there is no cure for SYNGAP1, which was a huge blow to us and we felt a sense of helplessness. However, we have hope and deeply believe that through the SRF foundation, extensive research into the invention of a drug for SYNGAP1, treatment is possible in the near future.</p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Anthony was born happy and healthy on March 29, 2004 in St-Georges in the province of Québec in Canada. His big sister Laurie was 2.5 years old and could not wait to play with her new baby brother!</p><p>Anthony was a very calm baby, rarely cried, let himself be led by life. He had a bright gaze, a gentle smile but did not seek company or initiate interactions and he slept a lot. Anthony was always watching and smiling. He was such an easy baby that it became a cause of concern, I began to doubt the normality of his development. </p><p> After sharing my thoughts and observations with his doctor thus began tests, exams, and consultations with specialists. In 2006, we learned that Anthony had an overall developmental delay. Therapies then began: physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy. </p><p> In 2007, we heard about Dr. Jacques Michaud’s research project – which was nearly a 4 hour drive from our home. In 2014, we finally got a call from Dr. Michaud saying Anthony had Syngap1.</p><p>Anthony just turned 17. He has the maturity of a small child in an adult body with the character of a teenager. He goes to school and attends organizations that offer respite to parents. Above all attending these organizations allow him to have a social life. His language remains poor in vocabulary words but he understands more and more things and seeks to be understood by all means. He loves to \"ask\" and find that it earns him a reward! Anthony does suffer from epilepsy. Every day has not been easy he often displays anger and crying and a lot of uncertainty about his future. But in general, Anthony is a very happy teenager. </p><p>The love we have for him, he gives us back a hundredfold and only for that, he fills us with happiness. </p>",

She lives with her mom, dad, 5 year old brother, and her dog Martinez. </p><p>Since she was born, Charo has shown her strength to face the adversities that are presented to her. Her first fight was with breastfeeding and thanks to her tenacity and perseverance, she did not stop until she was victorious and was able to suck autonomously to feed herself during the first months of her life.</p><p>Charo has very few words yet she is still able to communicate with us effectively. She is very loving and affectionate with the people around her. Charo is especially loving with those she loves and idolizes the most, such as her brother Fermín. Charo and Fermín have a great relationship, which any parent would be proud of.</p><p>Charo goes to a special education school. She goes to many different therapies such as: speech therapy, occupational therapy, music therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy and equine therapy. The ones she likes the most are music therapy and equine therapy. The horse that Charo rides during equine therapy is named Top. One of her very few words is \"Top\". Her schedule is busier than many adults, however, her desire for progress and improvement means that she is never tired to comply with it without making any kind of excuses. </p><p>Do we have difficult days? The answer is yes. Charo engages in tantrums and self harm. Often the misunderstanding of her from our society can be difficult for us to deal with. When things are seemingly calm and normal, a loud slap shakes us once more to remind us that Syngap1 and the symptoms associated with are very much present in our life. But when those slaps shake us, Charo appears saying here I am! I'm not giving up! And she is who gives us strength by showing us the way, showing us that she can and that she is willing to try even harder.</p><p>Our little Syngap1 warrior is a fighter. </p><p>`</p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Kai received his SYNGAP1 diagnosis October 30, 2020. Our questions had finally been answered, but the answer was one we never imagined. Kai’s diagnosis came from a genetic epilepsy panel which was conducted after seizure activity was confirmed by an overnight EEG in May of 2020. Unfortunately for Kai, his seizures have yet to be controlled by medication. Kai has myoclonic, atonic and ansense seizures. He currently takes 4 different anti-seizure medications. On a good day Kai will have anywhere from 3-5 seizures an hour. On a bad day it’s closer to 10-12 an hour. For Kai though, everyday is a good one. He is the happiest, silliest, and sweetest boy. His infectious laugh and heart melting smile will put a spell on you every time! <br></p><p>Similar to many other Wednesday Warriors, Kai’s journey to a diagnosis of SYNGAP1 began with an unmet milestone. For Kai it was his lack of interest in eating, as well as what seemed like a struggle to chew and swallow. At 8 months old, our pediatrician recommended reaching out to an early intervention program. Kai has been working with that program ever since. At the end of this month we are hoping to transition Kai into our county’s PreSchool Special Education Program, also known as PEP. Just a couple of months ago Kai was able to begin his first in-person Physical Therapy. He absolutely loves it! We are hoping to begin in person occupational and speech therapy as well.</p><p>Kai loves cars, guitars, water, learning sign language and animals (especially his fur sibling). I’m still trying to get over the fact that Kai can clearly say and sign \"kitty cat\" but \"mama\" only seems to emerge from a cry. Of all of Kai‘s favorite things, number one is people! Especially his people; incredibly loving and supportive grandparents, uncle and aunts. The two coolest cousins a kid could ask for and the best big sister to always look up to. Kai absolutely adores his older sister Rylan. They spend their summers together splashing around, building forts and playing hide and seek.</p><p>Kai continues to make progress even though his seizures try to hold him back. He is already so determined and strong willed and he is only almost 3! He brings so much joy to every life that he touches and the world is a brighter better &nbsp;place because he is in it! <br></p>",

He has been able to walk since Christmas Eve of 2019, which was a huge milestone for him to overcome. &nbsp;Preston currently receives Occupational Therapy, Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy, Vision Therapy, and has a teacher come to his home one time per week.</p><p> </p><p>He continues to work on his speech skills, as he is currently n0n-verbal, however, he is excellent at showing us what he wants. &nbsp;We continue to work with medications to get his seizures under control, as this seems to be a battle we are always fighting. &nbsp;Lastly, Preston still refuses to eat any type of solid foods. &nbsp;He currently eats purees from a bottle. &nbsp;We continue to see our feeding team in hopes of getting better results.</p><p> </p><p>Overall, Preston has had a hard-uphill battle during toddlerhood, as most children with SYNGAP1 do. &nbsp;However, he remains kind, loving, and full of life. &nbsp;He loves to snuggle, be held, play outdoors, swing, play in water, and play with anything with lights or music. &nbsp;Each day Preston, as I am sure most of our children do, wakes up with determination, and resilience to learning. &nbsp;Some days I am simply astounded by his daily determination.</p><p><br><br></p>",

			"name": "Fallyn",
			"location": "North Dakota, USA",
			"full-story": "<p>Looking back, one of the first things we noticed about Fallyn was that she didn’t like to put weight on her legs as a baby. &nbsp;She was late to sit up, late to crawl, and gagged when we started introducing baby food at 6 months. &nbsp;As a baby, she rolled around the room to get to something she wanted. When she hadn’t started crawling by 12 months we got her enrolled in some therapy. &nbsp;It was also around 10-12 months we noticed she started to wave her hands in front of her face and she started to have an eye turn. Fallyn took her first steps around 18 months old. &nbsp;Because of her low tone she wasn’t the most steady and it took quit a while for her balance to improve and for her to gain independence. &nbsp;Around 19 months she got her first pair of glasses and around &nbsp;27 months she had bilateral strabismus surgery. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Once we &nbsp;introduced thicker puréed foods and worked with speech therapy we saw improvements in her swallowing. &nbsp;We do notice she still tends to overfill her mouth and doesn’t always chew her food long enough so we are careful to make sure she has foods cut up small enough. &nbsp;After we took away her baby bottle with milk in it she started to only want to drink water. &nbsp;She refuses any milk, juice, or flavored drinks unless it is a smoothie. &nbsp; &nbsp;Fallyn has dealt with constipation and gas issues from the moment I quit breastfeeding (3 months old). &nbsp;We did several doctor visits and tested for different allergies/intolerances but could never come up with any answers until we got her syngap diagnosis. </p><p>As a baby Fallyn actually slept fairly well. It was around 2.5 years when we started to have difficulty with her waking around 2-3am completely distraught and staying up for the rest of the night. &nbsp;After doing a sleep study we did find moderate sleep apnea. &nbsp;She had her tonsils and adenoids removed around 5 years. &nbsp;During the same surgery they corrected a lip and &nbsp;posterior tongue tie. We didn’t realize she had the ties until it was pointed out by one of her speech therapist. &nbsp;After her surgery we did feel we saw a large improvement in her sleep as well as her eating. &nbsp;On occasion she still wakes in the the night but it seems to be worse if she is sick. &nbsp;</p><p>Fallyn started to have staring spells around 2yrs and had a 2 hour eeg and mri at that time, which were considered normal. &nbsp; Fallyn saw a geneticist around 3 years who did a chromosome micro array, which did not give us any answers. &nbsp;After pushing a little bit harder for answers and getting a referral to a geneticist in Minneapolis, we were finally given the answer we thought we would never find. &nbsp;Fallyn's diagnosis came in December 2019, after getting results from whole exome sequencing. &nbsp;We have since had a 5 hr eeg which did not show any seizures at the time. &nbsp;She does not have any epilepsy diagnosis or autism diagnosis at this time. &nbsp;We have not noticed any obvious seizures but we have seen some episodes of staring, eye movements, behaviors when eating, &nbsp;that have made us question a second opinion or longer EEG. </p><p>Fallyn's first few words started around 2 -3 years old. &nbsp;She usually only says one word at a time and her receptive ability is much greater than her verbal ability. &nbsp;She has an easier time copying words then coming up with the speech herself. Fallyns knows her ABCs , colors, and some numbers. Fallyn struggles with understanding abstract concepts. Fallyn goes to kindergarten at a local public school and has an EIP with speech, OT, pt, and special Ed services. &nbsp;We are currently looking into possibility of ABA services or therapies to help with behaviors as we have seen an increase in behaviors this past year (hair pulling, biting self, throwing). &nbsp;Most of Fallyns behaviors are self injurious but on occasion she lashes out at family or people with whom she is comfortable. Fallyn has always had different sensory issues- auditory, tactile, oral. </p><p>She absolutely loves water, music, babies, outdoors, animals, the trampoline, &nbsp;baking, and YouTube. &nbsp;She has the biggest smile and her laugh is infectious. &nbsp;Fallyn thrives best on praise and positive reinforcement. &nbsp;Fallyn has one sibling, Mylah, who is two years younger. &nbsp;Although some days can be trying, they have quite a special bond and really do love each other. &nbsp;Fallyn can be very silly at times and she can also be very loving! &nbsp;At times she can be shy. &nbsp;She likes to watch people. When she does talk, she wants you to repeat and acknowledge what she said! </p><p>We are so greatful to have found the syngap community. We hope that with targeted therapies and a greater understanding of her struggles we can give her her best quality of life. &nbsp;It is so helpful to read what has and has not worked for different families and how to prepare for the future. &nbsp;We are hopeful for the future and the medical advances that we may see in Fallyn's lifetime! </p><p><br><br></p>",

She does not currently have an epilepsy or autism diagnosis, but we are continuing to monitor and evaluate for both. </p><p>We first noticed delays before Elsie’s first birthday. She was not crawling, talking, or walking and was not interested in solid foods. Elsie was diagnosed with global development delays and failure to thrive and began PT, OT, Speech, and Feeding therapy just after her first birthday. In the search for an answer to these delays, various lab tests were performed, all coming back normal. We were referred to an endocrinologist for further testing as well as a neurologist where Elsie was given a brain MRI. All normal results. We were then referred to genetics where Elsie was given Chromosomal Microarray testing, results still coming back without an answer. Finally, through Whole Exome Sequencing, we found that Elsie has a genetic mutation on the SYNGAP1 gene. With this result came both relief for an answer and immense grief of what the future holds for Elsie. </p><p>Each day is a challenge with SYNGAP1, but with these challenges comes tremendous joy. We have truly learned to celebrate the small things. We celebrate Elsie’s milestones in her own timing. Elsie is currently able to walk short distances with assistance, she is working hard to learn to walk independently. She is not yet able to speak, has poor coordination, and still struggles with eating. Elsie loves to swing, go for walks in her stroller, she loves bath time, books, her big sister, Ivy, and watching her favorite shows. Elsie is affectionate, loves big squeezy hugs, she can be silly and loves to giggle. </p><p>We have big hope that we can work towards finding a treatment for SYNGAP1 in her lifetime to improve her quality of life. We are so very grateful to have found a community of support from other SynGAP parents. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Jocelyn was diagnosed with SynGAP1 in January of 2021. She is nonverbal and does not walk yet. Unfortunately we live in a small town in Kansas and we do not have a lot of resources here which means she has yet to start speech, occupational, feeding, or physical therapy. </p><p>In October of 2020, her MRI findings showed she was majorly delayed as this was prior to her SynGAP1 diagnosis. In the beginning of November, I started seeing her look like she was sleepy even after she had just woken up. For a while I thought she was just tired until she did it more frequently. Jocelyn would stand in her crib and then just drop. Of course after noticing this, I did some of my own research and decided she was most likely having seizures. I called her neurologist and told her what was going on and so we eventually hopped into the car for an 8 hour drive to Kansas City to Children's Mercy Hospital. After an EEG, she was diagnosed with epilepsy. Jocelyn suffers from drop seizures. </p><p>We are thankful to currently have Jocelyn’s seizures under control. Next we are hoping to find a way to get all the different therapies she is in need of. </p><p>Overall, Jocelyn is a very happy little girl. Her smiles and laughter just make me so much stronger and know that I have to keep fighting to get the help that she needs. She loves being outside, going for car rides, and being with her older siblings. Jocelyn does crawl and can get up and down from the couch. I try my best to walk with her around the house as much as I can as she needs full assistance. Her sleep schedule changes every 3-6 days. As she has minimal communication skills we have to guess when she is hungry, needs changing, etc. I hope that one day she will be better able to communicate her needs with me. </p><p>I love my precious daughter very much and I hope to find out more about Syngap1 as we are only at the start of our diagnosis journey. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Enzo’s arrival into our family was cause for great joy. Until the first 3 months of his life everything happened as expected. Enzo was breastfeeding very well and everything was in normal range. At 4 months old he was diagnosed with nystagmus and strabismus and then quickly was given glasses. He was able to sit at 10 months, started crawling at 12 months, and then walked at 18 months of age. When it was time to start eating solid foods he refused and would only take a bottle. He would wake up every 2 hours asking for his bottle. When he was in daycare we got a call saying that while all of the other children took naps, the only one who did not sleep was Enzo. <br></p><p>In November of 2014, Enzo had his first seizure.Suddenly he rolled his eyes with quick blinks and fell backwards like a disconnected robot. We are still trying to figure out the magic dosage to keep his seizures completely under control. Although we had success with valproic acid in the mix, we had to slowly wean off as he started to have heavy bruising and balance issues. <br></p><p>It has been a journey with Enzo as his mood and temperament has changed significantly over time. Currently he is on keppra but we have lost our once happy child. Prior to this critical period, he was filled with happiness and laughter. Enzo would fight for everyone’s affection, mostly loving big hugs. He has always been very fond of instruments and any video that has music. Enzo will bring my fingers towards a guitar as he knows that is what needs to be done to make music. We love our Enzo, our warrior, very much. </p><p><br><br></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Kyle was diagnosed with SYNGAP1 in July of 2020. We honestly didn't think we would ever receive a diagnosis that would explain all of Kyle's symptoms. He had had several genetic tests (with negative results) when he was younger, but SYNGAP1 had only been discovered when Kyle was just three years old, so he was never tested for this genetic disorder until last summer, when his neurologist and geneticist suggested that we test again. Kyle has hypotonia and didn't walk independently until he was 3 years old. He is nonverbal, but uses a few signs as well as a Speech Generating Device, to communicate basic needs and wants. He is not yet potty trained, but we are currently working hard on teaching him. Kyle has atonic seizures and the onset of his epilepsy was just before his 2nd Birthday. Kyle has had speech, occupational, and physical therapies since he was a few months old. He has also participated in Hippotheraphy, which he loved. He attends a private school for children with special needs where ABA Therapy is used. Kyle loves to look at books, loves attention and cuddling, has an amazing memory, and the most contagious laughter!&nbsp;<br></p><p>We love spending time together, but the focus tends to need to be on our Syngapian in order for all of us to have a good time! Kyle loves swimming, going to playgrounds, and taking rides on elevators and on our golf cart. He also loves covered bridges, so our family has visited quite a few in our area. When Kyle is doing any of these things, he experiences pure joy.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Kyle needs full assistance and care 24/7 and, at times, my husband and I are overwhelmed, emotionally, not sure of what his future will look like. We hope that he continues to progress with his speech device so that he can communicate even more with us. We are excited to finally have a diagnosis so that we can connect with other Syngap families and learn from them, but also to help other families who have children who are younger and recently diagnosed.&nbsp;<br></p><p>I would tell newly diagnosed families to connect with others who have children with Syngap for support and hope, and advice on various things (such as potty training, communication, therapies, etc.) I would tell them that their life is going to have challenges and difficulties, but also much joy and happiness. If they not only focus on their child and the support he or she needs, but also to focus on themselves and get the support they need as the parents and caregivers of their Syngapian.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Kyle’s mother Kelli has a wonderful website where she writes and shares videos of Kyle to encourage other parents and remind them that they are not alone: <a href=\"http://www.KelliMcIntosh.com\">KelliMcIntosh.com</a></p><p>Kelli has also been sharing videos about her son which we urge you to watch: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkuUMttDLfk\" target=\"_blank\">What is Syngap1?</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO_5904e54M\" target=\"_blank\">SYNGAP1 Morning Routine</a>.<br></p>",

He loves to be outside, just roaming around. Music, singing, and instruments are mesmerizing for him. Ricky loves to watch The Voice, American Idol, and Little Baby Bum is his most favorite. </p><p>He has most recently learned what his head is thanks to Cocomelon and can point to it and say \"heee\", which has given us hope that he may be able to speak one day. He’s a very energetic, playful, loving, hilarious little dude. </p><p>Ricky is a routine baby and we rely on it heavily, but lately we’ve been trying to try new things like going to eat at a restaurant (sometimes it goes well and sometimes it doesn’t, but practice makes perfect, and Netflix helps). Ricky also has an unrelated mutation in his slc26A4 that caused bilateral hearing loss. We live in a small town with very little resources or inclusivity, but we’ve done what we can to educate and have been lucky enough to find childcare who care for him as best they can, and he has a family full of love and support behind him.</p>",

			"name": "Nathan ",
			"location": "Oxford, Mississippi",
			"full-story": "<p>Nathan, will be 4 years old in June 2021. Since he was born, he has been a sweet, observant, and happy boy – his whole face lights up when he smiles, and his laugh is adorably contagious! We saw early on that he was missing milestones but it wasn’t until we introduced baby food when he was 6-8 months old that we realized he had trouble swallowing. This was our first real indication that something was wrong. Since then, we have been tirelessly trying to figure out what made Nathan different. </p><p>Shortly after we entered our 2020 national lockdown my husband and I noticed Nathan would occasionally blink/roll his eyes back when he ate. It would happen so quickly and infrequently that I wasn’t able to catch it on video until August 2020 – by this time it was occurring a little more frequently. An EEG revealed that this was in fact epileptic activity. A genetic test was run for epilepsy-specific mutations and on December 15th we learned that Nathan has SynGap1. As we read about its presentations, we realized that Nathan had been displaying nearly every marker for SynGAP1 since he was 6 months old, but due to its rarity and relative recent discovery, wasn’t diagnosed (there are fewer than 800 diagnosed SynGAP1 patients worldwide as of March 2021). </p><p>Because of Nathan’s difficulty swallowing, he has been receiving feeding therapy since he was about eight months old. That quickly led to speech therapy since his muscles weren’t strong enough to perform the tasks they should. Physical therapy and occupational therapy were added due to his global developmental delays, low muscle tone and missing milestones. He has about 80 words but no consistent phrases. He is very attentive and understands so much more than we realize. He follows simple commands, even when asked to do things he’s not been asked before. True of other Syngapians, Nathan loves anything to do with water and escaping. We have found him fully clothed in the bathtub and shower and he has escaped the house into the backyard many times via our Great Dane-sized dog door!</p><p>My hope is that Nathan’s diagnosis informs more providers (and people in general) of SynGAP. I also hope that my advocacy for and dedication to providing the best care for Nathan not only raises awareness, but money for research for this and other rare diseases – both from private donors and governments. </p><p>As a newly diagnosed family, the hardest part of a SynGap diagnosis is mourning the life you thought your child would lead. Once you realize that you are not alone in this journey – SRF is a huge support for us – and that there are gains to be made for your child despite how hard everything is, you will find the strength to do whatever you can possibly do to support your child. I am excited by the pace of medical advancement and am confident we will see benefits for all of our children soon.</p><p><br></p><p><br><br></p>",

He is a big football fan and loves to watch Gillette soccer Saturday.<br></p><p>Thomas was then given an autism diagnosis at the age of 8. Thomas is largely non verbal, however, has some recognizable words. Thomas has problems with eating and sleeping. These are the issues we are still currently battling with.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Thomas was eventually given his synGAP1 diagnosis in March of 2012 via the DDD study. We were in total shock, as we never thought we'd find a cause for his issues. It was a relief to finally have a name and be able to connect with an amazing network of supportive families.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Thomas has recently undergone surgery and had a gastrostomy inserted and is mostly tube fed. He also has an issue with the pylorus muscle in his stomach so this was looked at during his surgery. Thomas has really come leaps and bounds, he is thriving.&nbsp;<br></p><p>He is now less aggressive and less violent towards us, however he will still engage in self injurious behavior.&nbsp;<br></p><p>He continues to have poor muscle tone and uses a wheelchair when outside. He also uses AFO'S to help support his legs to walk. Thomas has recently been hit with another setback in terms of his physical health, he is awaiting a spinal x-ray to check and monitor developing scoliosis.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Even with all this Thomas continues to smile and make us smile daily.&nbsp;Thomas is a wonderful human who loves life and shows us how to love!! <br></p>",

			"name": "Laila",
			"location": "Ontario, Canada",
			"full-story": "<p>She was diagnosed April 1st 2020 after 2 long years of advocating for genetic testing. We were told so many times not to expect any findings, and that we may never know what was causing Laila’s&nbsp; developmental delays. We knew there had to be an answer and we are thankful to finally know why Laila is Laila, and to also have a sense of community; we feel truly thankful to be able to connect with other SYNGAP families.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We noticed Laila was not meeting some milestones around 4 months, and by 6 months she was obviously behind. Most notably, Lailas' fine motor skills were non-existent and she was not able to hold anything in her hands or bring toys to her mouth as babies typically do. Around 7 months we noticed peculiar head dropping episodes that looked like infantile spasm seizures. She had her first EEG at Sick Kids hospital in Toronto at 7 months old. Infantile spasms were ruled out, but Laila has been followed by neurology ever since. She had her most recent EEG in July 2020 and while Laila has not ever had a seizure that we know of, we were told there is a propensity for seizures later on and she will continue to be monitored closely.&nbsp;</p><p>Laila began receiving PT, OT and speech therapy starting at 4 months old and currently is also enrolled in an IBI program for behavior where she receives 20 hours of therapy a week. She also attends a city daycare 2 days a week to give her an opportunity to play with other children. Laila’s social skills have always been a strength of hers. She has formed strong friendships with the educators and children. Laila’s biggest challenges are motor planning and aggression. She has a very strong desire to communicate and is very frustrated by her body not cooperating with her! She has approx 10 words and uses 10 different signs (her favorites are \"more\" and \"sorry\"), but the PECS system was introduced at IBI and she has almost 100 images in her book that she uses regularly!&nbsp;</p><p>Laila is mischievous, cheeky, cuddly and sensitive. She is persistent, wildly adventurous and yet very shy. Laila has an older sister, Samia, who she adores and tries her hardest to copy. She follows her everywhere and can always be pulled out of a bad mood by her sister! Like a lot of Syngapians, Laila loves water. She can be known to have multiple baths a day and absolutely loves swimming. In the cold Canadian winters Laila can be found sitting by the fireplace for hours, she is obsessed with heat. Laila loves car rides, rolling in the leaves in the fall, being pulled around in her wagon and swinging on her swing. She is very picky about what TV shows or movies are on and she is the queen of the remote in our house, although she hasn't figured out how to work it just yet.&nbsp;</p><p>The best piece of advice we were given upon finding out that Laila has SYNGAP1 was this: \"don't let her diagnosis overshadow her potential.\" Set goals and go after them! Laila has accomplished so much, made so many strides and done so many things we thought she may never do already. She will show us what she can do! Our biggest dream is that there is eventually a treatment discovered for SYNGAP1 and we will never give up hope that one is found in Laila’s lifetime. <br></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Ryker is 9 years old and is the youngest of three boys. He suffers from Absence and Eyelid Myoclonia Seizures. Ryker is non-verbal and didn't walk till he was 3 years old. Now you can't stop him. He loves to go, go, go!&nbsp;</p><p>Ryker's birth was different compared to his two older brothers. Ryker came out not breathing and purple. They swept him off to NICU and later brought him back to us once he was stabilized. They informed us all was well and he was a healthy baby boy. When getting discharged I informed the Pediatric Hospitalist that Ryker didn't cry once throughout the night and I was concerned. The physician shushed me and said, \"You should be thankful for a quiet baby.\" For the next 9 months at Ryker's Well Child check-ups I expressed concern to our family physician that Ryker wasn't meeting his milestones like his brothers did. Again, they reassured me that Ryker was healthy and that I shouldn't compare kids. Finally at Ryker's 9 month Well-child check I expressed I was not comfortable with their answers and requested they refer us to a specialist to prove me wrong.&nbsp; The specialist informed me he was cognitive of a 1 month old and his fine and gross motor skills were of a 3 month old. Even though the news was crushing, we immediately met with a neurologist and geneticist. For the next 4.5 years we did rounds of genetic testing only to get the same answer - all was normal. It wasn't until we requested the Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) that we finally received his diagnosis of SYNGAP1 when he was 4.5 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>From 3-6 years old we struggled with severe behavioral and sensory issues. Which resulted in self-injury behaviors or attacking the person closest to him. This was a daily event, With ABA Therapy and proper medication we were eventually able to minimize his meltdowns. His meltdowns now are usually triggered only by sensory.</p><p>Ryker uses a communication device to communicate. He continues to work hard at his weekly therapies and is currently working on jumping, so he can jump into the pool this summer!&nbsp;</p><p>Ryker is a smiley kid and loves all things water! He loves elevators, automatic doors, lights and currently curtains blowing. He has a funny sense of humor with some sarcasm and keeps his family and teachers on their toes. Ryker attends a regular public school that is K-8. He's Mr. Popular at school and knows it. He loves snuggles, tickle time with Dad and wrestling with his older brothers.</p><p>We are thankful for finding our second family in the SynGAP community through SRF.<br></p>",

			"location": "Canada",
			"full-story": "<p>Our sweet boy James just turned 5 years old. He was an easy baby, very passive. We didn't notice any delay until we ended up at BC Children's Hospital for a shaky eye at nine months old. With an unusual diagnosis of Spasmus Nutans in only one eye, we were sent to Neurology. They found some milestone delays and immediately admitted us for a CT scan which came back inconclusive. We had three possibilities at this stage; a brain tumor, cerebral palsy or a ‘1 in a million’ genetic mutation.</p><p>By the age of one we noticed we were missing many milestones; crawling, walking and talking. We had an MRI at this stage which seemed to rule out a brain tumor – this sounds like good news but the remaining options were very daunting. A brain tumor could possibly be treated and he could make a complete recovery,<strong> </strong>but now we were left with cerebral palsy or a genetic mutation. A good friend of the family had mentioned Angelman’s syndrome, as James had the majority of the symptoms.</p><p>We tried to get on a genetics study under a Cerebral Palsy funded program but failed, we didn’t meet the criteria. All the time we were missing more and more milestones. We eventually got on another study and in December 2019 when James was almost 4 we were told the result, Syngap1. We were told there is no treatment, no cure and that any medication would be to treat symptoms like epilepsy. They explained how rare it was and we would be ‘writing the book as we go, for others’.</p><p>At this stage I can’t clearly explain how we felt; probably the strongest feeling was protection toward James. The answers had changed a lot about the future and set our expectations but they didn’t change how we felt about him. We knew James and James knew us. We had to gather our strength and do this. It took most of the following year to absorb the gravity of the diagnosis. A year with COVID and lockdowns, absence of help and therapy.&nbsp;</p><p>So, the light at the end of the tunnel? James!</p><p>James is the sweetest, most gentle, kind, soft person. He tries extremely hard to do things and his determination to push himself is truly amazing. He is such a genuine soul. He will let you know if he likes (or does not!) like something. If James laughs - you absolutely made him laugh. If James touches or cuddles you - he absolutely felt an attraction to you. He is not capable of fake. It is an absolute delight to have such honesty in our lives. I cannot express how much we love him, for him.</p><p>A few days before his 4th birthday he took his first steps. He needs AFO’s to achieve this but it is wonderful! We celebrate his achievements at his pace. A milestone is a milestone and time doesn’t matter. His achievements are real breakthroughs. A few days a year James says “Dad” or “Mom” or what we think is “what’s that” – it sounds like “w sat”. We love hearing his gentle soft voice. We appreciate how much effort it takes his brain to line everything up to speak and know it may be six months until we hear it again.</p><p>Since he started walking about a year ago, we had half rise steps put in our house so he could enjoy more freedom and access more of our house. He has now learned to go up and down those stairs and we think he saw it as a challenge! Syngapians have memory issues and I’m sure that although it takes a while for him to remember something, when he does, he guards those memories as real treasures.</p><p>His favorite place to be is snuggled up with his Dad...cheek to cheek. He is truly a beautiful soul.<br></p>",

			"location": "New Jersey, USA",
			"full-story": "<p>After 64 years of searching for answers, Caren received her SynGAP1 diagnosis in June of 2020 after surviving COVID-19.&nbsp; Caren, our sister and myself participated in a Trio Whole Exome Sequencing test, which uncovered this remarkable discovery. Some of Caren’s diagnoses through her life have included Mental Retardation, Epilepsy, Autism Spectrum Disorder, hypotonia, congenital foot deformity, ataxia, sleeping irregularities, chronic constipation, Schizophrenia and Explosive Disorder. </p><p>Despite her struggles with various conditions, I would describe Caren as an affectionate, humorous and happy person. She loves to color, write letters, dress up, sing and dance. Above all, she is quite a foodie! Caren is the first born of four children and loves her family. She misses her late parents, and I believe they would have loved to learn that she is a SynGAPian.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Caren was first described as a fussy baby who would not breast feed. After only being ten days old, doctors recommended my mother to start using formula. According to Caren’s baby book, she would rebel during the introduction of solid foods and frequently gagged. At seven months old, Caren experienced her first seizure episode, and would continue to experience grand mal, petite mal, absence and generalized seizures throughout her life. More recently, Caren has been observed to have focal seizures.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In addition to trouble feeding and seizures, her developmental milestones were delayed. Caren first walked at fourteen months, and she only began to talk after three and a half years of age. Through childhood, Caren’s disabilities and behaviors were managed in various residential institutions. From the ages of eight to eleven Caren lived at home in an effort to try different learning approaches. After this time, she moved back into another residential home where she participated in the Special Olympics, community outings, dances, and vacations. She was even featured in several local new articles.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In 2013, our family moved Caren to a group home that was located closer to us. Her current group home and rehabilitation day program provides various necessary services such as occupational, physical and speech therapy, and 24-hour nursing supervision. Before the pandemic, Caren also participated in community experiences.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Currently, Caren speaks in short sentences and has learned to read and write phonetically at a basic level. Although Caren’s motor skills are not what they used to be, she is happy to just hold a crayon. She is very strong willed. Overall, Caren is loved by almost everyone who meets her!<br></p><p>My hope for the future is that Caren will continue to have the best quality of life and care, be happy, comfortable, and to be an inspiration for others. As the oldest known SynGAPian at this time, I believe Caren’s story can provide insight for upcoming research and therapies.&nbsp;<br></p><p>I feel blessed to have the support of SRF and this caring community. Once I found SRF, I realized I was no longer alone. I am now part of a larger family that understands and has amazing resources. I know that SRF is moving mountains for our SynGAPians! My advice to newly diagnosed families is to surround yourself with support, lean on each other, embrace this community in a way that you are comfortable with and make sure to take time to care for you! Our SynGAPians are truly happy, curious and amazing people!</p><p>Special thanks to Mike Graglia and the amazing SRF, the SRF directors, Daniel DeFabio and Illumina for sponsoring and supporting #CelebratingCaren! Please join us for the watch party by <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/caren\" target=\"_blank\">registering</a>!</p><p>-Nancy, Caren's sister<br></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Helena is our very active and determined little girl. She is aged 8 and was diagnosed with Syngap in October 2017, aged 5. She lives with mum, dad and her older brother and younger sister in England.</p><p>She was a relatively placid young baby, but we were alerted to potential problems at around 9 months old when she still couldn’t sit up unsupported and a physio was concerned about her muscle tone; after a number of trips to the paediatrician and with major milestones being missed, we received the Global development delay diagnosis. We had a brain MRI and some basic genetic tests done but were then placed onto the national DDD (Deciphering Developmental Disorders) genetic study and over three years later we received the Syngap1 diagnosis.</p><p>Helena now has the Syngap1 diagnosis alongside ASD, ADHD, severe learning difficulties, epilepsy, hypermobility, oppositional defiance disorder, early on-set puberty and sensory processing issues, amongst other things. Her epilepsy presents mildly at the moment, for which we are thankful.</p><p>Helena loves water, especially swimming and having baths, baking, eating ice-cream, face-painting, slides, swings and, most recently, she likes looking at a collection of garden gnomes outside a house round the corner. She of course likes her iPad and “daddy’s phone” where she likes to watch videos and listen to music; current favourites are Paw Patrol, Christmas songs and electronic dance.&nbsp;</p><p>Helena has some extremely challenging behaviours which we continue to try to understand so that we can help her more. Her aggression towards loved ones and her defiance are at best testing, seeing her hit and bite her younger sister is as heart-breaking as it is unfathomable. How our little warrior suffers inside is hard to imagine.</p><p>These behaviours severely impact our family life, our relationships, our work and our passions and dreams, but we have gained so much from the Syngap community and we hope to be able to help other families who are on this journey with us.<br></p>",

			"name": "Michael in Hong Kong",
			"location": "Hong Kong",
			"full-story": "<p>Michael (age 6) from Hong Kong is a happy, loving and sensitive little boy. He loves playing with water, listening to music, watching trains and carousels and reading books, especially Toy Story.&nbsp; Behind those big blue eyes and beaming smile is a little boy that has had struggles since birth. Every milestone, that most of us take for granted, has been difficult for him and has been delayed but he continues his best.</p><p>Looking back, I noticed signs that something wasn’t right from the day he was born. Michael is our first child. Born three weeks early at 5.9 pounds we had no idea and everything was a learning experience for us, we had no other comparable sibling. In the first few days I struggled to breastfeed and get Michael to latch. Even with the help of nurses it was a struggle and like many mothers I blamed myself that I didn’t have enough milk and got myself quite stressed over it. Soon I realized it was important for my tiny baby to get milk so after spending 6 weeks pumping and completely tiring myself out, I decided to use formula. Once again, Michael didn’t take to any formula and a lot of the time he would spit up his milk. Later, our pediatrician recommended that we put him on a lactose free formula. It was slightly better but still he would spit up.&nbsp;</p><p>Another thing I had noticed and which surprised my husband and I was when he had his first vaccinations. I recall for his bilirubin test, the doctor pricked his heel and he didn’t even squeal. I found this extremely strange in a baby and the doctors didn’t say anything about it but I now know this is a symptom of his condition and that Syngapians have a high pain threshold.&nbsp;</p><p>After one day from being discharged from hospital, Michael had severe jaundice and was admitted again for another 3 days. He was put on a drip and a doctor had told us later that this could be a reason for his condition but after a brain scan, that soon got ruled out. Few months later he was admitted again with breathing issues which were diagnosed as bronchiolitis which we found ourselves in and out of hospital with over the next few years. Luckily, as he has grown, his episodes have become less and less and his immune system seems to have gotten much stronger.&nbsp;</p><p>As months went by more signs became apparent. Just the way he would hold his bottle with his fists and not clasp it with his fingers. He never put any toys in his mouth like other babies. Whilst I consistently raised this to the pediatrician, I was told not to worry and thankful he isn’t picking up germs. Deep down I knew this wasn’t right as babies explore through sensory activity. At some of the baby groups I took him too, he would spend the entire session crying until I took him out because of the noise of other babies. He hated being in a room of a big gathering especially if it was noisy.&nbsp;</p><p>At 6 months onwards when I started to put Michael on solids, this was another difficulty. He wouldn’t chew anything and I was too afraid so would just puree all his food. I felt it wasn’t helping him but at the same time I was too scared he would choke.</p><p>When Michael was 18 months, still not walking, a speech therapist I had consulted had recommended getting his ears and eyes checked. She thought if he had trouble seeing properly or issues with his ears, may be the reason why he is unable to walk. Surprisingly, the week he got his new glasses, he started to walk. Whilst he was still very unsteady on his feet it was a start and a new freedom for him.&nbsp; As time went by, he started to get stronger. He used to love running around by the waterfalls close to where we live and trying to dip his little hand under them. Even today, he loves being in or around water and is a great soother for Michael when he is stressed.</p><p>Around this time, our pediatrician agreed that he wasn’t developing at the rate usual for a child of his age and referred us to a developmental pediatrician.&nbsp; On seeing Michael, she immediately recommended we get Michael into occupational therapy and physiotherapy.&nbsp; At the time speech wasn’t really discussed because a previous speech therapist had told us that children would usually develop their gross and fine motor skills first. In hindsight, we probably should have started speech therapy earlier.</p><p>Separately, we started to notice jerk movements in Michael. They wouldn’t last more than a second and were generally set off when he ate or drank or had a bath. One time when we were seeing the developmental pediatrician, she noticed something that she called a drop attack. We just thought he fell as he was unsteady on his feet but she thought it was worth a referral to a neurologist and to have a brain scan. Michaels brain scan had come back clear, however, the neurologist had recommended an EEG and that’s when they advised that they think he may have epilepsy. The neurologist had pointed out that it wasn’t conclusive but she thought he should start a dose of Epilim. We didn’t want to put Michael onto more medication given they were only 50% sure that he had epilepsy as well as the fact he was already on Beclazone three times a day for his bronchiolitis. Therefore, we took his results to another neurologist for a second opinion and he confirmed he had epilepsy and if we didn’t start giving him the medication, it could lead to a large seizure. Luckily, Michael has always been on a very small dosage of Epilim as he has only ever had myoclonic seizures.&nbsp;</p><p>However, with everything we were uncovering, we were still baffled by his milestone delays and thus we had a genetic test done which zoomed into a particular gene which is highly related to learning ability, MED13.&nbsp;</p><p>Around the same time, post the suggestion from a speech therapist, we consulted some doctors at Great Ormond Street for a multi-disciplinary assessment for Michael. The doctor we saw, who has 35 year’s experience in neuro developmental pediatrics, was very certain that he would be able to provide a diagnosis. He agreed Michael has autistic tendencies but like our developmental pediatrician, he didn’t think autism was the primary cause. We were sure this would get us to the bottom of his condition and therefore, we decided to do the assessment. Four months later we spent a week back in the UK at Great Ormond Street hospital seeing various specialists including speech and occupational therapist, psychiatrist, neurologists, geneticist, you name it. It was intense and whilst stressful, we were looking forward to getting a diagnosis at the end of the week so we can start treatment for whatever it was. The geneticist reviewed the results of the test we had done previously. He confirmed that the MED13 mutation that Michael had was a de Nuovo and he said it could relate to a number of syndromes such as Fragile X or Angelman but there were other features within these syndromes that didn’t fit the bill with Michael. Unfortunately, no real conclusion came out of the assessment and all they could put it down to was global development delay. The geneticist we saw said we could get full gene testing done but it would be highly expensive and the treatment would most likely be the same as we are giving now anyway. At the time, we decided not to take it any further.&nbsp;</p><p>When Michael was a baby, he was an excellent sleeper. However, as he got older, he would wake in the middle of the night and as we would say, have a party in his room. He could be up for hours at a time and some days be totally wiped out in the morning. Even today, Michael will wake up in the night but now he would just run into our room and sleep with us but still continues to wake up early in the morning. Back in mid 2020, we decided to have a follow up with his neurologist due to his increased sleep disturbances and the jerk movements were becoming more frequent. We had a conversation with her and she referred us back to the neurologist at the public hospital and we discussed with him about doing the full genome testing. It had always been in our mind but this time we felt this was the last resort and if we didn’t get a diagnosis through this then we will never know. Additionally, given Michael is at the school age, we thought getting a diagnosis would also help and better place him for any special needs school if/when required. In all honesty, if Michael could speak, we probably wouldn’t have taken this route and life would have continued believing he just had Global Development delay.&nbsp;</p><p>Three months ago, Michael was diagnosed with SynGAP1. Whilst it is still a shock to hear your child has such a terrible disorder, it was a relief to finally get an answer to something we have been searching for years for. At least we knew the treatment we were getting for Michael such as ABA therapy, occupational and speech therapy was the right path. However, what the diagnosis has allowed is for us to connect with other families through the Syngap Global family network and the Syngap Research Fund. Whilst we are relatively new to this group, we have already found it an excellent source of information. We are obviously concerned for Michaels future but are hopeful that there will be breakthroughs that will help our children with SynGap1. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

His developmental pediatrician at age 2 wrote, cause of PDD \"genetic or mitochondrial.\" It wasn't until age 3 that Jaxon was diagnosed with epilepsy and autism. Non-speaking, he began using a speaking device at age 5 amazingly able to navigate it. With incredible spatial awareness, he knows where every carousel, car wash, swimming pool and the beach is located. Jaxon loves water, the ocean and surfing. Since age 2, the \"Syngap Snap\" has taken on various forms which recently required a mood stabilizer. ABA therapy has made a tremendous difference with his rigid and challenging behaviors. Now a teenager and in puberty, the perspective on life definitely has changed. Jaxon is a smart, handsome, charmer with an infectious laugh who you cannot help but to fall in love with just ask his therapists.</p>",

Ilona is not able to talk to us verbally but she communicates her love loud and clear.<br>Our biggest wish is to be able to advance research in an effort to improve her and other Syngap kids and adults quality of life.

Sofia is kind and caring, laid back and has an amazing sense of humor. She really enjoys watching movies, going shopping and dining in her favorite restaurants. Sofia is very feminine and is keen to make sure she dresses nice and looks cute. She deals every day with many difficulties due to her limited cognition, decreased motor skills and challenging behaviors. Despite all this however, she manages to stay very happy. She is our hero. Therapy has always been very helpful for her. In particular, ABA therapy has been very important in helping her by focusing on her most significant challenge, her behavior. Deep down inside we know that Sofia wants to help heal that brain of hers so that she would be able to have more clear thoughts and process things clearly. This would help her more easily connect with people and the world around her.<br>We realize that the only hope in finding appropriate treatments and a potential cure is through more significant and much-needed research in Syngap. Increased public awareness and education will be important in bringing more attention to this critical illness.</p>",

More than anything, Erich loves attention and to make people happy. Often, he is more interested in a persons’ response than completing the actual task at hand. Everyday, he works very hard in his therapies and at school. He loves to eat ice-cream and to be outside walking around and looking for trucks and tires. He also enjoys swimming, hanging out in his Thomas the Train tent, swinging and climbing. He is starting to explore different drawers in the kitchen and other rooms, looking for interesting things to put in his mouth. He also enjoys riding horses and playing hide and seek. His absolute favorite thing to do is snuggle with mama and papa to watch Stinky and Dirty on Amazon prime. We are waiting for the next season in great anticipation. We hope that Erich will be able to communicate his needs and remain happy and alert. Ultimately, we are always hopeful for a treatment to increase his Syngap protein production levels.</p>",

She swims in the pool and the ocean. Duck diving and holding her breath longer than anyone we know. While Jaeli is friendly, cuddly and giggles often, she becomes overwhelmed and frustrated dealing with her impulses, insomnia, seizures and hyperactivity. Jaeli is happy but we wish she could articulate her needs better.<br>We dream of a day when Jaeli is independent, can advocate for herself and tell us exactly how it feels to be a Super Syngapian.</p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Kimberley has 2 older siblings who love her dearly and are so patient and understanding. She still has a big impact on them as they’ve had to learn extra patience.</p><p>We noticed Kimberley showing signs of delays from 6 months old as she didn’t crawl, sit up until much later without support as well as late walking and never babbled.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Kimberley was diagnosed in 2013 with global developmental delays as she had no speech. She showed behavior problems such as, aggression, self harm (biting, hitting her head).<br></p><p>After 4 years of being in the unknown we received our SYNGAP1 diagnosis in March of 2020.&nbsp; We received this diagnosis from 100,000 genomes project genetic testing.<br></p><p>Kimberley suffers with sleep disturbances. We give her melatonin but she still wakes up most nights and stays awake. Her brain just does not seem to want to shut off. She is still in diapers. She has limited speech, on her best days she says around 8 words. She has obsessions that can lead to extreme frustration. If she is on her iPad (watching ambulances or blippi) and it suddenly switches off she will go into a rage. Kimberley has a high pain tolerance. She has no danger awareness so she has to have 1:1 care at all times. She thrives from routine and familiar settings, shows aggressive outbursts when there is change. Currently she is showing absence and myoclonic seizures but we are currently waiting on an EEG for further testing.<br></p><p>She attends a Special Educational Needs (SEN) school which she loves going to. Kimberley loves music ,dancing ,horse riding, being outside whatever the weather. Most of all, she loves water, a true Syngapian.<br></p><p>Kimberley is the most determined little girl I know, she can be very affectionate and happy. We all love her so very much.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Having a SYNGAP1 diagnosis was tough to hear but we have the best support from other families like ours were a huge SYNGAP1 family I don’t know where we’d be without them.<br></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Around age 2, we knew something was going on with our little Payton. She wasn't talking as much as her sister. We always called her our quiet child. It took her almost 17 months to walk. We started looking into tests and procedures to uncover what's going on with Payton. Around 3 years old, an EEG revealed she was having seizures. Which broke our hearts. Many more tests were done all of which uncovered nothing. Until October 2014 (age 6), when we got a call from metabolic indicating they found what Payton has, #Syngap1! This was hard to hear, but in the same breath, we had a label; an answer as to what is going on with Payton. How does this affect her? She is slower than most children her age. She has apraxia of speech, so she doesn't talk smooth like everyone else. She has to stop and think about what she wants to say. Payton is like a drunken sailor. She is off balance either due to her medication or her condition. She has low muscle tone and has many accidents and falls from time to time. She works hard to fit in and wants to be accepted. She is loved by many and her smile lights up the room. She has amazing determination to try hard and stubbornness to be independent. Currently she is participating in karate and ballet. She seems to enjoy both. We love her for everything she does and is and wouldn't change anything other than this genetic mutation. If we could give her anything in life, it would be to have all the abilities that the rest of us have. The ability not to allow seizures to intrude on her capacity to learn and grow. The power to increase her intelligence and grow up and have a career and a family and to be loved and appreciated and give back to the world in a way that she would enjoy. I pray that continued research finds solutions to help us find the normal button.</p><p>- The Durrett Family, Finding the Normal Button<br></p>",

However, we say this with pride and conviction as we have seen Vivaan fight against any complications thrown at him.</p><p>We learned about his condition in January 2018, and what an emotional journey it has been for all of us. Vivaan had to go through a series of blood tests, EEG sessions, and also a very painful CSF test for the doctors to find out that he has SynGap1. All throughout his tests and doctors' appointments, he used to be calm, cheerful, and full of life; like his name suggests.</p><p>He struggles with his speech but with continuous speech and occupational therapies, Vivaan can say at least 25-30 words now and has also started to try saying new words (not clearly) by himself. We have noticed that with repetition in different activities, he can understand and learn a lot of things. He has excellent problem-solving skills and can communicate his likes/dislikes to us with actions and signs.</p><p>Our biggest worry is what will happen to him when we're gone? Today we are here to take care of each and every little necessity of his, but we will grow old and there will come a time when we won't be there to do anything for him. Due to this concern, our goal is make Vivaan as capable as his condition can let him be and live in this world with a happy heart and smile on his face.</p><p> - Mom</p><p><br></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>John is 4 years old and lives in Aitkin, Minnesota. He was diagnosed with Syngap at age 2 ½. John was delayed since birth, we started therapies around 11 months old. He sat up independently at 13 months old, crawled at 15 months and walked at 23 months old. Along with the Syngap diagnosis he also was diagnosed with epilepsy and autism. John is nonverbal and cannot do sign language due to poor motor skills. John uses a device called LAMPS to communicate his needs, which he is still learning how to properly use. He is a happy little farm boy who enjoys tractor rides, side by side rides, skid steer rides, lawn mower rides.. pretty much anything he can ride on. He enjoys feeding the pigs and chickens, and just recently started riding his pony. John loves water and is usually covered in mud everyday during the summer. He struggles mainly with comprehension and behavior. John is usually happy and has a very loving laugh. John loves his sister so much, they do everything together. He may struggle daily but if he is motivated, then he will overcome anything that gets in his way.</p><p>-Mom</p>",

We were already raising a 2 year old Syngapian (undiagnosed at the time) so when Elise started developing the same as older sister Lily, we were familiar with the journey. As soon as Elise had her first seizure at 2.5 years old we started to hunt for a genetic diagnosis and our \"why?\" We have carried on through the years with PT, OT, Speech, feeding therapy, etc (all times 2!). Elise is one of the most social and empathetic little girls I have ever met. Her biggest challenge for a long time was communication and through many years of hard work she is able to communicate most of her needs through some verbal approximations, touchchat, and signs. Elise loves to swim, ride bikes, play with her dolls and play with her fellow kindergarten friends.</p><p> - Mom of <a href=\"http://syngapresearchfund.org/warriors/lily\" target=\"_blank\">Lily</a> &amp;&nbsp;Elise</p>",

I am 3.5 years old and from the age of 1.5 we knew we had Syngap1. I have also been diagnosed with epilepsy. Unfortunately, epilepsy is not yet completely under control. This is probably because I had a cerebral infarction during pregnancy. Because of the medication I get fewer absences (with myoclonische characteristics), but i have still 10 absences in a day. According to my mom and dad I am a happy boy. Together we have a lot of fun. But occasionally my parents doesn't understand me. Maybe it’s because I cannot speak yet and that makes communication very difficult. I also have a very nice wheelchair, an adapted chair and a high low bed. These tools help me to develop further in the right way. My mum and dad are working on adapting our house so that I can be cared for even better. Last year I didn't have to go to the hospital anymore. Occasionally I don't like the food and for that I had to go to the hospital regularly. Eventually they gave me a PEG probe so that I can eat whenever I want and if I don't want I get my food through the PEG. Then I still get enough food, which makes me less likely to fall ill.</p>",

Two weeks ago you were able to read my brother's story and now it's my turn.</p><p>Since I was 1.5 years old I knew that I have syngap1 just like my brother (Nick). Although we are identical twins, we are still different. But with many things we look alike and we are the same in our development. My biggest challenge is food. I have had a PEG probe for over a year. It helps me to get enough food and drink. Even though I don't feel like eating. Just like my brother, I have epilepsy. You will not see it because the epilepsy is under control with my medication.</p><p>I talk to everyone a lot. But I don't get understood. But that is because I make many sounds instead of words. We do have some resources to start communicating, but I don't understand a thing. Instead I make everyone laugh and then I have a lot of fun too.</p><p>Furthermore, I am not in a hurry to develop. I can crawl a little but then I will stop. I still have a nice wheelchair where my mom and dad can transport me. It also fits in our beautiful new bus. But I also get a nice walker and a standing table. With that, I learn to stand and maybe walk. But I have more difficulty with that than my brother.</p><p>We are very happy with all these tools, but they take up a lot of space. My mom and dad are busy making our house even bigger. And then my brother and I will get a nice bedroom on the ground floor. And a bathtub in the bathroom. Because I don't like a shower at all. A shower makes me completely overwhelmed and then I scream. With a lot of practice I think the bath is ok. As long as they don't wet my hair or face.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed my story and my brother's. If you want to see or hear us more often, you can check out our blog on Facebook “Syngap Twins\"<br></p>",

It wasn’t until last summer, when Andrew was 16, that a new round of genetic testing revealed his SynGap1 diagnosis. Needless to say, it was a life-altering moment for our family, as we had been searching for our “why” for such a long time.<br></p><p>Andrew is now 17, and attends a specialized non-public school dedicated to providing students with autism and related disorders access to a robust, individualized education in a safe, compassionate, accommodating environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Andrew has many interests, including bounce houses, the beach, swimming, watching YouTube videos and playing with his iPad, going to church, Disneyland, watching favorite scenes from Disney Pixar movies such as Monsters Inc and Cars, playing Little League Challenger baseball, going bowling, and spending time with his best friend in the whole world, his brother Ian.&nbsp;</p><p>While Andrew does have verbal approximations, he does not talk in the traditional sense. However, Andrew utilizes a variety of low and high tech functional communication skills, including sign language, gesturing, pointing, using his speech device (Proloquo2go on a dedicated iPad) and other creative means of getting his point across, which we like to refer to Andrew’s Charades!” Recently Andrew began taking Epidiolex for his intractable epilepsy, and has been seizure free for two weeks! Woohoo!</p><p>Andrew is affectionate, funny, smart, loving, creative, and continues to grow in amazing ways. He brings such joy to everyone who knows him, and we are in awe of his unique perspective on the world. While his diagnoses often cause Andrew many challenges, he is our hero and we are so very proud of him! <br></p><p>- Jo (Mom)</p><p><br></p>",

Akira had hundreds of seizures per day including absent with eye fluttering, myoclonic jerks and atonic. We struggled to find doctors who believed us about how fragile Akira was. Finally, at the age of 6 we got the evidence we needed; an EEG showing hundreds and hundreds of seizures over a 24 hour period. Akira loves horseriding, swimming, the beach, school and her Autism Assistance Dog Jagger. She has started to learn to use Proloquotogo on her ipad to communicate. . Akira is living a wonderful life now full of all of her favourite activities. Akira is gentle, loving, affectionate and cute as a button. She loves to get tickled and play peek a boo and chasey.

			"full-story": "<p>Will is a 9-year-old boy who was diagnosed with Syngap1 when he was 6 years old. It was noticed he wasn't developing normally around age 12 months. He had no spoken words and was not attempting to walk at all; was barely crawling. Will remains nonverbal. He is very vocal, however, and I believe he has a lot he would like to say. Will uses a speech generating device and goes to an amazing school where he is encouraged to communicate all day long with it. Will has been in various therapies since he was 18 months old including speech, occupational, physical, and behavior therapies. He has a seizure disorder which includes atypical absence and atonic seizures. He had many drops as a toddler from the atonic seizures and has had stitches and staples in his head, loss of nerve function resulting in a gray front tooth which thankfully came in white as a permanent tooth, as well as a fractured clavicle. He eventually got a protective helmet which helped with head injuries. Will has tried many seizure meds and has never been fully controlled. He had a vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) implanted when he was 4. After that it felt like we experienced a miracle. His drop seizures seemed to have been cured. He still takes two heavy seizure meds as well and we see occasional breakthrough absence seizures. Will has aggressive behaviors when denied access to what he wants. He also doesn't understand danger and is a very fast runner who doesn't normally listen when told to stop. Will is an extremely-active child and rarely will you see him not moving. He loves playing basketball, climbing stairs, watching ceiling fans, and opening and closing doors. He is also very affectionate and loves the people in his life. He has a fun-loving personality and you can't help but enjoy his genuine happiness.<br></p>",

Reaching that diagnosis at 5 years old was a long stressful adventure. Her original diagnosis’ were global developmental delay, nonverbal, hypotonia, and mental retardation- all at 17 months. By 2 years old, she was diagnosed with autism. The neuropsychologist who diagnosed her made a stunning comment, “I wouldn’t be shocked, if sometime in her future, you came back to me and told me it [Autism symptoms] was genetic.” Then, 3 years later, after witnessing seizure activity, she was diagnosed with a genetic disorder, known as Syngap.<br></p><p>Today, Claira presents with atonic drop seizures, absence seizures, and eye flutters. She enjoys her service dog, Soleil, and he keeps her safe. He’s trained in tracking (she elopes), seizure alert, and behavior disruption. The behaviors are our biggest challenge. They can be intense most days, but she has the biggest heart and most beautiful smile!</p><p>Claira loves horses, cows, moons, fish, and swimming. She’s happiest riding... on anything really! She’s completely nonverbal, with a few simple signs and an iPad for communication. Weather permitting, you will find her in the pool most of the year if she’s at home!</p><p>She has opened our world in more ways than one, and puts a smile on everyone’s face she meets! <br></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>She was diagnosed with SYNGAP1 around age 6, after years of genetic testing. She was born healthy but began showing signs of developmental delay from about 6 months old. She didn't crawl, eat solids or babble like other kids. She began early intervention and various therapies from age 1. She has been in a special education program since age 3, which is around the time her petit mal seizures began. Her early diagnosis was hypotonia, developmental delay, gross motor delay and epilepsy among many others. Today she goes to school, has private speech therapy 2x a week and in-home ABA support 2x a week. She loves her teachers and is one of the hardest working girls we know. Her 7th grade year was a little rough, as she is transitioning from a young girl to teenager. Thankfully she is verbal and can communicate basic needs, although writing and complex motor activities are still difficult for her. She loves using devices, typing, and listening to music on YouTube. Although many things are difficult for her, she is a happy girl who is eager to learn and loves her family.</p>",

There he practices his motor skills in his wheelchair and his walker. However, what he likes most is being on tour with his family. Whether it’s for a day out and about, a family holiday or traveling to meet other Syngap families. He likes to increase awareness about SYNGAP Elternhilfe, the German patient organization.</p><p>Jamie struggles most with two topics. 1. Transitions, he can’t cope with the ending of fun activities and starting something else. 2. Lack of speech is a huge topic for him as for many other syngapians. Sounds and syllables came and disappeared again. To overcome this, he has an AAC device that helps him to communicate with people around him by the use of symbols.<br></p>",

Although, her endurance and balance is still not great. Luckily she loves riding in her wheelchair! Some of Melody’s favorite things include animals (especially dogs), pb&amp;j sandwiches, water, and snuggles. In her 4 years of life she has already endured X-rays, MRI’s, blood draws, and countless hours of therapy. The areas we struggle with is Melody’s lack of communication skills (she is nonverbal) and sleeping. We currently are working on just the right dose of medications to help with her sleeping. Getting the diagnosis of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/syngap1/\">#syngap1</a> in September of last year, was an answer to our prayer as we were able to put a name to her developmental delays. Finding other families who share our struggle has been very helpful as we navigate the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/syngap/\">#syngap</a> world with our sweet girl.</p><p> - Anna (Mom)</p>",

At 6 months old, we began noting developmental delays/low muscle tone. An MRI was conducted and returned normal. We began with weekly physical, occupational and speech therapies. Seizures started in March of this year and increased to 50-100/daily at worst. This spurred more EEGs, multiple attempts at medication for seizure control (still ongoing), more lab work than any toddler should endure, epilepsy panel, and whole exome sequencing. On July 30, 2019, Carter received his SYNGAP1 diagnosis — and the symptoms all matched.</p><p>Carter attends ABA therapy, focused on socialization, and improved behavior/speech. He is mostly non-verbal, but has begun mimicking/saying a few words. The newest being “baby,” since he just became a big brother in the past few weeks! We’ve also begun introducing sign language.&nbsp;</p><p>Carter has become very independent as he’s gained confidence with walking (still a bit wobbly)! He’s a sweet, happy and charming baby — he’ll instantly steal your heart! We indescribably love this boy and will do anything to give him the best life possible!<br></p>",

			"location": "Johannesburg, South Africa",
			"full-story": "<p>Emmitt is the third of three brothers. His name, respectively, means “whole/complete\" and \"happy\" (in Zulu) and we are determined as a family to help him live up to both of them despite a challenging diagnosis. Around nine months we really began to realize that Emmitt was not just a laid back baby, but that he was developmentally far behind where his brothers were at that age. He was diagnosed with epilepsy at 16 months, though we suspect he was having seizures since around nine months, but that they were very barely noticeable. Seizure control remains one of our biggest challenges at the moment. Emmitt will be 2 in November and is beginning to take some independent steps, identifying some basics shapes and animals, and always showing us that he understands more than he can express. No understandable words yet, but he has something to say about everything and loves to have people use prompts for different words on his face.</p><p>We have found living in South Africa (as Americans) to be a challenge with access to different types of therapies, knowledgeable neurologists, and being far from family and our usual support structures. On the whole, our South African friends have been very understanding of our situation and have shown tons of love and compassion towards Emmitt. Disability is seen different here than in other parts of the world, and, in some ways, we are grateful for that. One of the daily issues we face is that many places we go are a sensory overload, packed with people, many different smells and always lots of noise. It can be a bit overwhelming for anyone who is not used to it, let alone someone with Syngap. Without a doubt, our two older boys are one of the biggest assets to Emmitt's development and character. They love him for who he is and enjoy getting wild and crazy with him on our trampoline. Now that we have a diagnosis, we are constantly looking for ways to improve his life and to make sure he meets his full potential.</p><p><br></p>",

His APGAR scores were 8/8. He was breast-fed and then added in formula and some solid food such as baby Gerber rice around&nbsp; 5 months. It was around 6 months that our pediatrician was concerned that Shaan was not meeting his gross-motor milestones such as rolling over and sitting up properly. He wasn't really making eye contact, not babbling consonants, etc.. Around age 1, we enrolled Shaan in early intervention and had a panel of genetic testing, all which came back negative. His MRI also came back normal.&nbsp; Our neurologist diagnosed him as PDD-NOS and which allowed us to enrolled Shaan in our town's special needs program.</p><p>Currently, as a 15 year old Shaan is nonverbal with some gross-motor delays and overall hypotonia. He can walk, run not really jump or skip. He communicates basic needs with an I-pad using Apple's Proloquel. As of now, he has&nbsp; not had a seizure that we are aware of and we do look for the staring seizures as well. He loves to swim, go for walks, go for car rides, and spin on the floor. He is a picky eater and is short and thin for his age. He sleeps through the night and is extremely grouchy in the morning. He is very sensory seeking and craves deep pressure and high rigorous movements like swings. He functions with repetition, praise and verbal behavior with gestural prompts. In addition to us as caretakers, he has his 12 year old brother 2 other routine sitters.</p><p><br></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Tommy is our SynGAP warrior who was finally diagnosed in October 2017 after a very comprehensive and extensive medical workup. He has a splice mutation at Intron 13, epilepsy (primarily Lennox-Gestatut patten). We have seen at least 5 different types of seizures, tried multiple AED medications and various combinations and have settled on Lamictal, Tripeptal and Topamax. He is very limited in his expressive language, has bowel issues, global cognitive developmental delays that were first noticed at 4 months old. We currently have him in a fabulous autism school program, in-home support, and recently added ABA therapy as behavioral issues and outbursts have become more significant. Tommy has an infectious smile, loves ‘warm fuzzy’ attention and his big brother (26) ia a hands down favorite. He also has a 23 year old sister. Some of his favorite activities are watching and cheering at high school sporting events, chuck-e-cheese and bowling in a special league and going out on our boat hoping to see \"ales\", also known as dolphins. His other favorite is a collection of lawn chairs and I mean about 30. He enjoys looking at pictures and youtube videos. He is very social and active in our community of Chesapeake. From what I know he is the only diagnosed Syngapian locally. He brings our family so much joy, despite the challenges and he has taught me patience and adaptability. I love him with all my heart. I like to say I live with Superman!</p>",

			"full-story": "<p>After a two-year medical marathon with countless examinations, we received the Syngap1 diagnosis in April of 2017.</p><p>Benjamin is a very happy little boy! After learning to walk at 2 years old, nothing was safe for him. Benjamin sees no danger. He has no awareness of cars, buses, and tractors that drive through the village. In addition to the lack of risk awareness, he also has problems with perception. He feels pain much later or not at all. So it happens again and again before he reaches the power fence for the cows, and is then standing with the cows! Benjamin always needs 1:1 care, you cannot take your eyes off of him.</p><p>Animals are a big passion of his. Cows, horses, cars, and our golden retriever, Grace. The first two weeks we had Grace was very difficult. Benjamin would pull her fur constantly. Luckily now, the two are very close. Benjamin seeks her and Grace does not leave his side if he is having a meltdown.</p><p>Benjamin is very active and likes to be on the move! He likes to run around the hockey turf with his hockey stick when his siblings are training. In addition to hockey, he also loves water and swimming. He loved music, preferably very loud.</p><p>As of September, he has started a special school. Benjamin’s vocabulary is of about 10-15 words. If he learns a new word, another disappears.

			"full-story": "<p>Chloe lives at home and 5 days a week she goes to a daycenter for complex needs in our town. She also has access to respite which means she has a lovely social circle. Chloe attended a specialized school up until she was 19 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The SynGAP1 diagnosis only came 3 years ago, after being on the DDD study for 4 years. It was a huge relief! Originally At 3 years old, Chloe was diagnosed as being non verbal, having global developmental delays and hypotonia. It has been quite a journey since then. At age 7, Chloe was diagnosed with a Rett syndrome variant, despite having a negative test for the mecp2 gene. Eventually the Rett’s diagnosis was withdrawn when Chloe was 14. She didn’t display any of the major signs of Rett’s. Chloe did not receive an epilepsy diagnosis until the age of 18. When Chloe was 15, she experienced the major loss of her grandad, which caused major regression. We lost our Chloe for a very long time.</p><p>Chloe is a very different young lady to the child she was. Chloe was very sociable, her mobility was better, and she was generally more managable, Now her behaviors now are much more challenging. She’s now finally progressing after years of regression. In my opinion, her regression was caused by grief.</p><p>Chloe loves male company, she loves the show Tweenies, she is an wizz on youtube, loves spinning flashing lights, pajamas, yogurt and crisps. Chloe lives at home with her mum, dad and her two brothers who are 9 and 11. We are fortunate enough that our home was adapted for Chloe. She has a ground floor bedroom with a wet room. So we can keep Chloe home for as long as we can.<br></p>",

We never dreamed that we would one day discover the cause of his condition. Francis has not displayed any signs of having seizures. For our son, behaviors are the most challenging.</p><p>Before the age of 13, Francis was hospitalized twice in a mental hospital due to aggressive behaviors. At the age of 13, we found a special home for him that could cater to his needs to the fullest. Putting Francis into a home was the hardest decision of our families lives. As a mother it broke my heart immensely to do so. But life has it’s way to make you slowly stronger.</p><p>Now Francis comes home every other weekend and is still greatly attached to his family. We are still a very strong family unit. Francis has an older sister (age 25) who has become a special needs teacher. He has impacted all of our lives in a positive way and taught us many things along the way.<br></p><p>- Chantal (Mom)</p>",

We saw many professionals over years and Reuben had MRI scans, many blood tests, Lumbar punctures, initial genetic screening tests and other procedures but these didn’t give us any answers to his development delays. In 2014 we were entered into the UK DDD (Deciphering Developmental Disorders) study and 18 months later Reuben was diagnosed in 2016 (aged 4.5) with SYNGAP1.</p><p>Reuben has a mutation in SYNGAP 1 which has caused him to have an intellectual disability, global developmental delay, autism, behavioural abnormalities, hypertonia, impaired language development and sleep issues. Reuben has some words but mainly communicates through his Makaton and his PECS.</p><p>Like most children with SYNGAP1 Reuben loves water, animals especially horses, goats, cows, sensory activities and has the most infectious laugh and giggle. Reuben loves music and has brilliant rhythm, he enjoys dancing to his favourite songs.&nbsp; He is a thrill seeker which we discovered recently, he signs more when the rollercoaster stops!</p><p>Some days are quite challenging as Reuben gets very frustrated and lashes out at us and others too. He struggles with transiting from his favourite places and thrives on routine. He has no danger awareness and is very strong willed and determined.</p><p>We are truly blessed to have him in our lives and he brings happiness in so many ways. He has made us see things in a new way, taught us so much and is our little hero who has overcome so such. He continues to make us proud every day with new milestones and achievements.<br></p>",

Since then, he has been receiving OT, PT, and Speech Therapy and has gone through countless tests. We knew from the beginning that something was different about Chase and that he didn’t seem to match any diagnosis that we knew of. He began having seizures when he was 3 years old and we finally got the testing that we had been fighting for from the start, which is when we got the Syngap diagnosis.</p><p>Although Chase struggles through countless seizures, coordination issues, and motor delays - he is still the happiest little boy there is. He wins everyone over with his big amazing smile and his contagious laugh. Chase is so resilient and when he falls or do not succeed at something he gets back up and tries again. His easy going personality and eagerness to learn despite his struggles are an inspiration.</p><p>For a little guy who sometimes struggles to walk and run, he absolutely shines on his 3 wheeled scooter! He can scooter so fast that we have to run to keep up. Along with riding his scooter, he also enjoys blowing bubbles, swimming, reading books, and listening to music. Chase uses a communication device at home and school. He is learning to put two words together on his device. Chase still does not have seizure control, but we are hoping to figure out what works best for him soon.</p><p>-Mom<br></p>",

His early life was not easy for him, nor was it easy for us trying to figure out how to help him, especially with his aggression. At six-foot, one-inch and 205 pounds, he was challenging. Today his aggression has decreased substantially, he still has 20-30 Atonic seizures daily (40-50 on a bad day), 2-4 drop seizures a week. All of these still even with three anti-seizure medications and a Vagus Nerve Stimulator.</p><p>‍<br>- Mom</p>",

When she was much younger (5-6 years) Celia went to many hospitals in the US to try and get a diagnosis but nothing came of it at the time. But now that we have a diagnosis we are receiving great help from our local neurologist who specializes in epilepsy.</p><p>Celia has no verbal communication, only 4 words, motor problems to walk, severe intellectual disability, severe disruptive behavior and she is very sensitive to stimuli.</p><p>Until she was 19, Celia attended school in a special needs classroom. Unfortunately her seizures have prevented her from attending school regularly. Celia suffers from generalized, drop, and myoclonic seizures.</p><p>The key to keeping Celia happy is maintaining an active lifestyle. Walks, swimming, going to the beach, are all activities she enjoys doing regularly.</p><p>When she was younger she traveled a lot with the family but now it is not possible due to behavior. She likes going for a ride in the car and loves getting into buses to go to the city center. Celia has always kept up a heavy therapy schedule as well.</p><p>She loves music, dancing, using make-up, dolls, using her ipad for music, etc. She communicates in a very effective way trying all the strategies she has (signing, inventing her own signs, pulling other’s people hands), she is very energetic and seems happy all the time, she needs a friendly environment and no stress at all.</p><p>She is under strong medication in order to control behavior and epilepsy. Medication apparently produced ammonium high levels in blood, during the last year she is having difficulties for walking and we have to use a wheelchair frequently. However, in the last two weeks she is gaining some strength after some drug changes.<br></p>",

He has two brothers who keep him company. Lukas loves going to equine therapy and enjoys swimming. Driving in the car and riding in trains are activities he looks forward to greatly.<br></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Kailyn, Kai for short, was diagnosed with SynGAP1 in December 2019 at the age of 4. Although getting the diagnosis was difficult news to grasp, it also provided relief in the sense that we now had the answer to what causes her symptoms. After her first birthday, Kai started having extensive meltdowns as well as compulsive aggressive and intense self-injurious behavior. Soon after, she began having what we now know are myoclonic seizures. At 3.5 she was diagnosed with generalized epilepsy. Her events are classified as myoclonic and atonic. Up until recently, she suffered ~200 episodes daily. After lots of tinkering with medication, her clinical seizures have subsided; only just in the last several weeks. We are cautiously ecstatic! Kai is also diagnosed with autism, severe apraxia, and global delay as well as being faced with hypotonia and ataxia.</p><p>We recently celebrated Kai’s 5th birthday! Despite her challenges, Kai is fun-loving and has a magnetic personality. She LOVES activities involving lots of sensory input including water and swimming, sand, and loud music/musical instruments. She is thrilled by the lawn mower, motorcycle, airplanes, and other construction vehicles. What Kailyn lacks in verbal communication she makes up for with dramatic facial expressions, endless high-fives, and a captivating smile.</p><p>Although Kai will continue to face obstacles surrounding her speech, coordination/strength, and behavior, we are incredibly hopeful to see what the future holds for her and all of our precious Syngapians.<br></p>",
