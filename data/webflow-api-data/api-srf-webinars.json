He has focused his clinical practice and research in complex epilepsies, both in pediatric and adult patients. He is currently working on epilepsy surgery, genetic epilepsies and developmental encephalopathies. He is involved in multiple clinical trials of precision medicine.&nbsp;</p><p>He is highly active as a scientific advisor for rare disease and collaborates with patient advocacy groups like ours.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h2>Transcript:</h2><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: Thank you for having me. Thank you all the Syngap Research Fund team for inviting me. I think you are you are doing really a great job because we need a lot of dissemination in this in this area of genetic epilepsies, of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. We need more awareness and more research and and we need you. This is really important. </p><p>So I'm going to to talk about types of seizures, how are seizures in SYGNAP1 and also how important is electro electrocephalography in this in this population. I'm sorry for my strong Spanish accent. I hope you understand me fair enough. </p><p>So this is the classification of seizures and also the classifications of epilepsy types. You know, classically, traditionally, we were using a classification of epilepsies using only the information of whether the seizures were focal, if only a part of the of the brain was involved, or if the seizures were generalized when bilateral quickly bilateral or the whole brain was spiking at the same time. </p><p>So now in the last classification in 2017 we have the etiology part which is more and more important and the genetic part we know is important for more than 70 percent of people with epilepsy and SYNGAP1 is one of the examples. So we have like also a traditional classification of epileptic encephalopathies: West Syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, Dravet Syndrome. All of those were based only in EEG electrocephalography and semiology of seizures. So all the genetic information we have now it's sometimes is difficult to get into these traditional classifications. So sometimes we I would say we \"force\" the syndrome to get into our patient. So we call it like \"Dravet-like\" syndrome or \"Lennox-Gastaut-like\" syndrome or \"Rett-like\" syndrome because these traditional syndromes are not useful for every patient. So the genetic information is more and more important and this is something we know is not something really rare. So in the last few years, in the last two or three years, we are deciphering the so-called epidemiological aspects of genetic epilepsies and we know that a lot of patients with epilepsy who are starting with seizures in their first years of life have a genetic background which is the cause of the of the disease. So we have like, two models. I would say one model which is the model of Dravet syndrome which is a success model because Dravet syndrome was a traditional a classical or a classical epileptic syndrome and most of patients with Dravet syndrome have a positive mutation in SCN1A.</p><p>However, all of these, SCN2A, CDKL5, STXBP1 or SYNGAP1, they don't show a specific traditional syndrome. So it's better to go reverse and to define new syndromes, new features, of epileptic seizures and semiologies regarding the specific mutations. So we could say that there were like three stages of phenotyping and semiologies in epilepsy. The first classic one was only taking in account the electroclinical syndromes, the EEG. Then during the 90s and the the last decade using neural imaging and stereo EEG, invasive EEG, we could also know some new features of semiology of seizures and epilepsy. And the last wave or the last stage is genetics. It's the area or the field in epilepsy which is growing faster and faster in the last years. </p><p>So SYNGAP1 is one of the most frequent genetic causes of epilepsy. The first description curiously was in 2009 and the first patients described had no epilepsy. That seems interesting because actually more than 90 percent of people with SYGNAP1 have epilepsy and this is one example of something we were talking about previously, that SYNGAP1 encephalopathy we cannot introduce it included in one traditional syndromes, one traditional epileptic syndrome. This is a nice publication from 2019 in one of the most important journals in the world of neurology which is the Neurology journal. They described patients from a lot of countries and they described that most of them had epilepsy and the most frequent age of onset was two years of age. This is important but some patients started at six months, some patients at six seven years. And they could be include included in two classical syndromes: Doose Syndrome, which is an epilepsy with myoclonic atonic seizures (we will see some videos of these typical seizures) and also Jeavons Syndrome which is characterized by what we call absences with eyelid myoclonia. We will see later on some example of this. So you see some of these patients could not be included in none of the classic epileptic syndromes. </p><p>If we go reversely, so not from the genetics to the syndrome but from the syndrome to the genetics, we can see that in this nice publication, it was published last year in 2020 with people with myoclonic atonic seizures, you can see that some of these patients have the genetic testing positive for a SYNGAP1. So you can find SYNGAP1 reversely from syndrome to genetics, from genetics to syndrome. So just to have an overview how we classify, how we talk about seizures: we have generalized seizures, they are absence seizures, myoclonic seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures. We have also focal seizures when there is an area in brain which is causing mostly the seizures and they could be without an impairment of the awareness, or with impairment of the awareness. And we have other seizures like epileptic spasms or atonic/tonic seizures. </p><p>For example here we have a spasm. Spams are like that. Sometimes they are in clusters, like some of them in a short period of time. I would like to thank all the families who share their videos for educational and also research purpose.</p><p>For example, this is an example of focal seizures. Sometimes seizures are very, very mild and you need an EEG to see them. For example this smile was a focal seizure frontal missile. This is also a typical seizure we can see in in SYNGAP1 which is atonic seizure. You see there's a drop, head drop during chewing which is very typical of SYNGAP1. There is also a tonic extension of upper limbs. The patient is this, the father is this.</p><p>So you see there are also myoclonic seizures. So this episode for example we could think is a normal myoclonic episode of sleeping which could be physiological, could be normal but if you perform an EEG, an electrocephalography, during night sometimes you can catch some of these episodes which could be also epileptic.<br>This is something quite typical in SYNGAP1 with photosensitivity and myoclonic seizures. Let's see it again. With the light you see myoclonic jerking. This is typical for<br>a generalized. And here we have an example of tonic-clonic seizure, generalized tonic-clonic seizure during photosensitivity.</p><p>So this is important because the main seizure which is causing fractures and traumatic injuries are convulsive generalized tonic-clonic seizures, also atonic seizures, drop attacks could cause fractures also spinal cord and tongue problems. This is a SYNGAP1 patient you see here. This is the signature of eyelid myoclonia. You see there there is like jerking of the eyelid. This is important. I want you to see it properly. You see the eyelid the myoclonia is like a subtle jerking with the upward of the eyes. Now again. Now again.</p><p>Sometimes in SYNGAP1 we see these that if they are without attention without doing anything they just self provoke seizures. Also we see sometimes seizures which are triggered by visual patterns like these, like the shirt, the drawing of the shirt. </p><p>So this is the signature of eyelid myoclonia and eye closure sensitivity we call it, and this is typical of Jeavons Syndrome. Do you remember? Jeavons Syndrome is related to SYGNAP1. Some patients with Jeavons Syndrome has a genetic testing positive for SYNGAP1 and what we see in the in the electrocephalogram is this is the blinking, so the eye closure. This is the artifact. And then just after that we see the generalized discharge. So this is the typical electric signature of these patients. And we see this in Jeavons Syndrome. This has been studied for a long time that there are some interruption or some dysfunction in the occipital lobes which are the laws in charge of processing the visual information. So because of that in SYNGAP1, those who have a Jeavons-like syndrome, they have a photosensitivity, light sensitivity or visual pattern sensitivity or eye closure sensitivity. So this is also something described by my colleague Andres Jimenez Gomez and his team. They have described some changes in occipital areas in the EEG both in the background and in the electrons in the epileptic discharges. So this is another example of the eye cluster signature. You see here what we were talking about. The artifact of the eye closure like we are going to see it again. Here. You see the artifact of the eye close. You see the eye close and then just after that the discharge with a little bit fluttering of the of the eyelid.</p><p>And this is also something we see in SYNGAP1. Sometimes there are pattern sensitivity. This is not very frequent but we see sometimes pattern sensitivity and this is something we have to explore during the video EEG monitoring. We show some visual, specific visual patterns with lines, with circles, and so on.</p><p>And this is also something we have a specific diagnostic tool which are the Frenzel glasses. With these glasses we don't allow the patient to fix the sight. So then we can see a fixation-off pattern which are the epileptic discharges during fixation-off. So when the patient cannot fixate the sight. And this was the case for this girl.<br>So this is also an example here with the tablet, with the screen. Just at the moment we have an atonic seizure, like losing the tongue and falling behind. We have this patient again. And this is something interesting because sometimes changes when the seizure starts are very subtle and the families are really professional in capturing and and detecting when the seizure began and you families sometimes say \"we can see there is a subtle change in the face\" mimic the face movement and this is something we can see in this patient. Right now You see? Like the face changes and this is an absence seizure. This is something we cannot control or we cannot monitor if we don't perform a prolonged EEG. And you see this is the end of the seizure and again she has a normal expression in the face. </p><p>So the EEG is important. We know it. We could think about what is the best timing for an EEG and this is something which has been studied for a long time and we know the best moment for an EEG is just after a seizure. So if you have a, if the patient has a seizure if you perform an EEG in the 12 hours after, we will see more changes and it would be more useful. And for how long? It could be another question. For how long is better to perform an EEG? So we know it's better as long as we can. So 12 hours is better than 4 hours and 24 hours maybe is the best to get some information regarding subtle seizures, discharges during sleep, and so on. </p><p>So this is another SYNGAP1 patient. You can see that during drinking or during chewing you can have a seizures like this. This is a tonic seizure and it was triggered by drinking and this is something which has been described typically in SYNGAP1 the eating epilepsy sometimes is also drinking epilepsy which is seizures provoked by this. But this is important. We were really really into the concept of epileptic encephalopathy that seizures and discharges could produce a developmental delay and cognitive problems but now we know that sometimes the cause is not epilepsy and it's just that we have a cause, a genetic mutation like SYNGAP1, and the mutation has different symptoms. One of them could be the epilepsy and the others could be developmental delay, motor dysfunction, cognitive problems but the epilepsy is not the main character producing the developmental delay. It's more the etiology, the cause, the genetic cause which is in the background. So because of that I always like talking about this: the quaternary prevention. You know, I like the cognitive aspects or cognitive bias we doctors have when we treat patients and families and you know as doctors we like prescribing. We want to give pills, we want to treat everything but sometimes we have to, you know, to take care of our emotions and about our anxiety treating our patients and try to decrease the medication in some situations because we have, we can have what we call the \"prescription cascade\" because sometimes you start with a drug you produce a new medical condition which could be a new adverse event then you start another drug for the medical condition which which was caused by the first drug. So you are producing more and more problems regarding this.</p><p>So then sometimes we have to be more precise, perform EEG in our patients, slow down, taking care of the details, and sometimes deprescribe. So take out some medications if we don't see any benefit in our patients and that's epilepsy precision medicine. We have to look for specific etiologies, we have to look for specific patterns in EEG and to choose better and wiser our prescriptions. But for that, in order to get precision medicine, we have to perform more prolonged EEG, better MRI in some patients, and of course genetic testing but we know there is a huge diagnostic gap and this is something we have studied in our team the diagnostic gap in people with epilepsy and intellectual disability with probably genetic epilepsies and we know adult patients they are not studied well. They were not studied when they were children because we didn't know the genetic causes of epilepsy and we have to update this workup and perform more genetic testing. So this is all I wanted to conclude with this: epilepsy is one of the main features of SYNGAP1-related disorders. Some characteristics are very specific very, very typical like the chewing epilepsy the Jeavons and those overlapping syndromes but sometimes the patients have not a really specific epilepsy. They have myoclonic seizures for example and this is quite typical for other genetic diseases and I think video EEG is really important to be more in deep in our patients, to study them better and to give a better decision-making for drug choosing. So this is all. Thank you all for your attention and I'm happy to answer any questions you have.</p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Thank you very much. Now I can tell you already this webinar will become one of our greatest hits and I think it's important for people to know the story of this webinar. We had a Congreso Cienífico in February where you were one of the speakers and you gave this presentation there and it was so popular we asked you if you would give it in English. So that's why we're here. We knew this would be good. Thank you so much for that and thank you for all of the care you give to our Syngap kids and all the other kids with with these genetic diseases. Our patients are lucky to have you. I have a lot of questions and I want to encourage the audience. I know we have clinicians and researchers and parents and please just everybody ask your questions put them in the Q&amp;A. Can you talk more... so there's one question that's already from in from Mr Sachin and he says: How can we treat genetic epilepsy? Please advise first line drug? And in addition to answering that question I wanna add two things on the Syngap flavor: I see a lot of patients who are on... not a lot... some of our patients present with eyelid myclonia. Somewhere in the literature it says eyelid myoclonia or absence seizures, I think it says absence seizures: ethosuxamide. So they start ethosuxamide, it doesn't work or the seizures get worse, add lamictal, doesn't work, seizures get worse epidiolex... So I literally, two days ago I was talking to a family on these three drugs epidiolex, ethosuxamide, lamictal. And they're like \"maybe we should add Onfi\" and as somebody who is... and I recognize your job is very hard and I'm glad you're doing it but my question for you and neurologists is always... and this is related to your prescription cascade point... Neurologists seem to be very good at adding another drug. How much do you guys talk about (maybe quietly in the corners at conferences) about taking away drugs that seem to have done nothing but are still flowing around these little kids and you know, doing something, you know? Sorry that's a hard question but... </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano:&nbsp;Yeah, no, no, we have to be self-conscious about this all cognitive bias and all the, all our psychological aspects you know. When we do our decision making during clinical practice and yeah, you are completely right, yeah. It's very difficult for us to go back, to take perspective to, I don't know, to destroy your own narrative in your case. It's like you are having decisions and it's difficult to change them. But for sure this is a direction we have to go through. We have to decrease the medication in general because sometimes we are treating electrocephalography and we are not treating patients. We are not treating families and we have to change it and think more about quality of life, think more about sleep, think more about behavior, because this is something the other side sometimes you are treating seizures and you are improving seizures but the behavior is worse. So that's... that does not make sense. So yeah. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;So then, we agree. We agree and of course you know my opinion is unwelcome because i am not a doctor unlike yourself or Marta but I still ask them I think are we sure this is not too many drugs? Anyway but Mr Sachin's question is interesting and I think a lot of people have it. Is there a first-line drug for a genetic epilepsy?<br>In general for genetic epilepsy? That's the question, yeah. </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano:&nbsp;Yeah really, really hard question. So I would say when you don't know how to treat your patient normally you start with Valproic. Valproic because there are really few genetic causes which could worsen with Valproic. There are some of them like mitochondrial, some metabolic diseases, could worsen with Valproic but it's yeah, the less, less bad in general. So if I have to to start with one drug at the beginning I would start with that. But I would perform fast genetic testing and this is something we have to ask for. Now we in our hospital we have the possibility to have the genetic testing in one week and a half, the results. So I think this is something we have to fight for. </p><p>Marta:&nbsp;Yeah then extrapolating that to Syngap. Are you still thinking of Valproic for Syngap?</p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano:&nbsp;What is my experience on Valproic? Yeah. Yeah, so &nbsp;didn't have really really good experience with with Valproic but again maybe it's because when you have a drug which you are starting with this drug always like Valproic acid, you know very well the bad side of this drug. So because I'm a second opinion center so I always see the bad side of Valproic. Patients normally come to me after Valproic. So because of that I have that bad experience. So maybe it's not a bad drug. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Ángel do you mind if I? Can you stop presenting just so we get more faces and less screen? </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: Oh yeah. So yeah.</p><p>Mike:&nbsp;That's that's great, thank you. So a lot of questions are coming in and I'm thrilled to see three, at least three SRF board members here. If anybody wants to talk live please just let me know but I wanna go to Hans' first question because it's a really good one. Do any other genetic epilepsies have a similar EEG profile to Syngap? How (related question because Hans thinks about biomarkers) unique is EEG in Syngap? </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano:&nbsp;So I would say it is not unique. So for example CHD2 which is also another genetic epilepsy quite \"common\" among the rare epilepsies, you can see really, really similar EEGs. Also we had the last week another patient with this kind of EEG patterns and he had a TBR1 mutation so we have some genes which could show like SYNGAP1 but you know it's more about probabilities. If you have this syndrome you have the probability to find this and this and this and this. So it's not a the whole spectrum of genes. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Got it and then Nancy's asking two great questions too. First is does the video EEG pick up on the eyelid myoclonic seizures and I'll just add to that personal editorial we get a lot of parents who go into the hospital with the button and they press the button and I can't tell you how many doctors say to the parents \"when you pressed the button nothing happened\" and the parents were like \"no, I pressed the button because there was stuff\" and the doctor's like \"no, when you pressed the button and when the stuff was happening, different times\" and so I wonder if that's real- I don't know what's behind Nancy's question but does the video EEG always pick up on the eyelid myoclonic seizures is what she's asking. </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: I would say yes in my experience. I cannot tell my colleagues' experience. I don't know but yeah. No but I think it's a like a very typical signature. So it's difficult to lose eyelid myoclonia. Yeah. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;And then maybe it's more of the absence that I'm thinking about because I we also have like when a child starts showing delays and having absence seizures ages two and three, you know, something happens, somebody orders an EEG, they go to the hospital and then this is a conversation I know a lot of people have had: the doctor says it wasn't a seizure. There was some abnormal activity but it wasn't a seizure and the parents are like... I'm still not sure what that means. So how would you explain and then what I say to them is come back in six to 12 months and suddenly it's a seizure, right. It's almost like it's slowly progressing from okay to seizure but because what Nancy's second question is you know her first one was like what Marta said what is the best recommended medication and how do you convince people that your kid's actually having a seizure? Sorry... all these hard questions. </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano:&nbsp;Yeah, no, no, it's nice and it's also a teaching for me to have these questions. I certainly I don't know. I think we have to rely more on families in general because for rare diseases you know more about your kid than we know. So that's for sure. My professor when I started in the world of of epilepsy he told me that at the beginning, you know, Dravet Syndrome is very famous is the most popular among the genetic epilepsies and Dravet Syndrome is very typical for excitation-triggered seizures and also to febrile (fever) triggered seizures. So my professor told me Dr Hilario my mentor he told me that at the beginning they didn't believe the families. They thought the families were creating that relationship between fever and seizures or excitation and seizures. So yeah, at the beginning you have to, I don't know, to fight to do things like this, to create meetings among doctors and families and yeah in the end we have to be more horizontal in our relationship with families. I think that's something which is changing with the new generations of physicians of neurologists. I hope so. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Me too. </p><p>Marta: Extending to that Ángel then we're talking about a family that got reported an abnormal EEG, that means that the lower- the threshold for seizures is lower but they don't report seizures and then how do you deal with that because that's the question we get all the time because you know that kid is a has I mean it's increased at risk for seizures. Do you treat that in Syngap knowing that 90% of the patients are going to finish having true seizures or how do you deal with that? </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: Yeah. So there is also a cognitive bias for doctors. We call it the \"tool bias\" that for a hammer you only see.. how you call, nail or...? Yeah. So for physicians we only see seizures because we only have anti-seizure medication. So we we don't have medications for the underlying cause. So because of that we are like very concentrated on seizures so because of that sometimes we we want to look to other side and don't see the EEG abnormalities. This is something also which is changing because for example in tubular sclerosis, which is another genetic epilepsy, for the first time in history we have proved that if you have an abnormal EEG and you start medication you can prevent epilepsy. This is something which is the first time in in the history of neurology because we couldn't prove this before but this is only for tuberous sclerosis. We don't know if we could make it for SYNGAP1. We need more research on that. </p><p>Marta:&nbsp;And to extend to that point Mike and I were talking. The older kids there are few of them. Of course we don't have many teenagers that are transitioned to adulthood but we have at least two patients and I think three thinking about the people that I know in Spain that when they turn 16, 17, 18, they got worse. Yeah. They start with the epilepsy then if there is any thought maybe of something that will protect the brain to progress to that. </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: Yeah. Do you mean people who didn't have epilepsy and start during teenage? </p><p>Marta:&nbsp;Yes. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;They had absence. They had pretty mild seizure phenotype and then right around 16, 17, 18, 19, they presented with a big tonic-clonic and they had to up all their meds a lot. </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: Yeah. Yeah sometimes we see that. For sure this is something we have to describe like the \"adult phenotype\" of SYNGAP1. Yeah.</p><p>Marta:&nbsp;And just for curiosity what they are using for tuberous sclerosis for prevention? </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: Vigabatrin. Yeah, I don't think it could work well for SYNGAP1. It's another physiopathology yeah. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Yeah I'm gonna... there's so many great questions here. So Nancy Kessler is asking another one and just so you know, I hope you've seen that movie about Caren the 65 year old patient. If you haven't we'll send you a link but we have a 65... You have? </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: No, no I haven't.</p><p>Mike:&nbsp;We'll send it to you. It's very, very good and her sister Nancy who's been caring for her for 65 years so you could argue Nancy is probably one of the world's leading Syngap experts at this point and once she was diagnosed with Syngap only last year at the age of 64 That diagnosis helped them get into the care of Dr Devinsky who sees most of our patients in New York area and and she's saying Dr Devinsky said that the activity can be very deep in the brain and may not always show. Caren shows abnormal activity and slowness. So just staying with this theme that we're hearing from patients of like they don't know... the Syngapians don't always present seizures on the EEG but there's a certain kind of abnormal activity and slowness and is that just normal for all encephalopathies or is that, could that be something that is, that we can agree is as a Syngap signature? Because it's just... and I'm only asking this because parents come out of meetings with neurologists confused. You know the neurologist said there was no seizure. I know my kid has SYNGAP1. I know stuff is happening. I'm seeing eyelids move and they said it was abnormal and slow but no one understands what... I don't know other people do I'm sure. I don't understand what abnormal and slow means. </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: So yeah, again so normally in electroencephalography we see like three different things: one thing is the background, which is could be normal or with a slowness as as you were saying, one is epileptiform activity with or without symptoms, and the third one is seizures. So eyelid myoclonia, absences, tonic-clonic, whatever. So the background slowing this is something where we see in a lot of different diseases so it's not anything which is specific. This is something which is a little bit frustrating as well for doctors because is we know there has to be something more specific for every genetic cause and for example we are starting a new research with our with a university here in Madrid which is trying to use artificial intelligence you know deep learning processing to see some signatures in the EEG that we cannot quantify with the neurologist's eye. So this is something which could have could give us an answer on this. The problem with this kind of research is that you you have to have a lot of EEGs. So you you need like 30 patients with SYNGAP1 and it's difficult to get so many EEGs on a rare epilepsy like SYNGAP1. That could be a project for the future. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Yeah. I wanna... I invited Sydney up from our board to ask a question. She can tell you about her son but he has a- I would love it actually Sydney if you could spend a minute talking about Emmitt's presentation and all of the medications he's been on because he's one of our serious cases. Go ahead Sydney. </p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;Sure, okay. Hi Dr. Serrano thank you so much for the really informative webinar. Can you guys hear me okay? </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Yeah. </p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;Okay great.</p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: We cannot see you. We can hear you but not see you. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Okay I'll move her over to panelist and then we can see her. She has a lot of questions she should pepper... there we go. </p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;Hey. My child Emmitt he's three and a half now but I think Marta and Mike will agree with me that he's way on the severe side for epilepsy in SYNGAP1 and much like you described the progression of epilepsy type and frequency that's seen in adults, I actually believe I've seen that in him already. From the time of six months he was definitely having eyelid myoclonia and by the time he was 12 to 14 months the myoclonia went from several times a day (where I thought I was crazy) to being you know, one to two hundred times a day and having full body atonic drops, head drops, clonic jerking of the limbs as well and all of this progressed within like six months from six months to about 12 months. And at this point I think we've been through seven meds with having five of them at a time even as well as keto diet plus meds and in every situation I find he's just incredibly medication resistant. Currently on five meds he is still having at least 100 myoclonia a day with probably a dozen to 30 head drops as well and we just feel like we don't know what to do but it brings me to my question of do you have a best guess for what mechanism or mechanisms are responsible for some of our kids being so resistant to medications and others who are treated with valproic acid and that's it. </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: Yeah. So for sure we don't know yet but some hypotheses we are exploring are other genetic variants. You know, like, there is there is something which is being studied which is the polygenic risk score. I don't know if you know it. It's something which is not applied normally in clinical practice but we know if that probably if you have a high genetic polygenic risk score probably your monogenic disease SYNGAP1 or whatever it could be more severe. So sometimes we are we are speaking about the myth or the legend of a monogenic disease. So it's not that there is no monogenic disease. So you have a mutation in SYNGAP1 but you have a lot of other genetic traits which are modeling and changing the the expression of this and also other environment factors like but we don't know right now. For sure for example the brain-gut axis some behavioral aspects, educational, family aspects but we don't know. Sorry my answers are not so precise but this is what we have now. </p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;No that's okay it's understandable there's definitely a lot of pieces to the puzzle so we're thankful for scientists who are doing what they can to help us understand how they all fit together. My second question for you is my neurologist has described my child's eyelid myoclonia sometimes as atypical absence and then other times like as an eyelid myoclonia and I've just been so confused by that and I want to understand why is he calling it two different things how do they overlap and in that case where an eyelid myoclonia might be considered some kind of atypical abstinence does that mean we should consider medications like ethosuxamide which are obviously useful for treatment of absence seizures.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: So sorry I did not understand eye- eyelid myoclonia and what is the other?</p><p>Sydney: Absence, yeah </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: yeah so yeah eyelid myoclona is just the jerking of the eyelid which can be associated or not with the the absence seizure so the problem is sometimes for all of the diseases expressed with eyelid myoclonia we know that they are going to be refractory so even people with mild syndromes with eyelid myoclonia without intellectual disability and without any other seizures we see that they are really, really refractory. </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: So we we have not good medications for for eyelid myoclonia. Sometimes we, I have a good experience with perampanel in some patients, with valproic in some patients, with brivacetam or levetiracetam in some patients, Stiripentol maybe in some patients but they are yeah, mostly refractory. </p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;Okay. Yeah, I mean that's definitely been our experience. So maybe I'll just go out on a limb and ask you another hard question and see what has your experience been recommending VNS or corpus callosotomy for your patients who are just so incredibly medication resistant.</p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: So... yeah, definitely is not... we don't have really really great experience with VNS and callosotomy. Callosotomy you have to choose very well the patient because you can decrease the cognitive profile and it's only useful for atonic, for drop attacks. This is the only efficacy and the VNS, the good point is that it's not very harmful. So if it's not working it's not very harmful and yeah, the efficacy can be as one of the other medications. So sometimes it's working, sometimes it's not working. </p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;Okay. I really appreciate your honest and thoughtful answers and thanks again so much for taking time to share with us hey. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Thanks for your question. Yeah this is this is great. This is great. Thank you Sydney. So Raymond Holden if you're if you're reading along and he'll- and then-</p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: I have like five minutes more because they are calling me from the video EEG monitoring. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Okay so let me be quick. Yeah. Ray Holden says we have a 12 year old diagnosed nine years ago with drop and eyelid. Sodium Valproate worked but we still have myoclonic eyelids due to growth and puberty. Question: do you have any other ideas on adjuvants that might help cognition? And they've used Keppra and they also use CBD. So this is the, if I can extrapolate Ray, this is one of the challenges we have as parents, right? We pile on the- we fight the seizures. We pile on the drugs. We see cognition slip and then people start saying is there any way to facilitate the cognition? Because ID is you know, one of the underlying characteristics. </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: So... yeah, the best tool for cognitive is to have the lowest medication. So if you see that with 400 milligrams per day valproic acid is the same for seizure control as 800 per day, go down to 400. So the minimum, the minimal dosage that's one of the the main points. The other is to try new medications. We are trying, this is something which is starting now and we are in the middle of bureaucracy war, you know, but we are trying to perform a clinical trial with Fenfluramine which is a new anti-seizure medication and we have really good experience with it in Dravet Syndrome and in Lennox-Gastaut. So this is also a new tool to try new medications. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Is that going to be a basket trial? I heard from that company... </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: We are going to, no, we are going to perform a specific trial in SYNGAP1 but with really few patients is, someone maybe I shouldn't talk about this but because it's something which is yeah, in the... we are working on that but I hope we can start that in some months. So it's a specific trial in synaptopathies STXBP1 and SYNGAP1. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Please let us know if we can help. We we work closely with STXBP1 here in the states and I know exactly the company you're talking with and we are very excited about that drug. So that that study is important. </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: I hope that's working. </p><p>Marta:&nbsp;And before you go I really want you to answer the question of Encarnación. She has a hard case of her daughter. She's from Spain and her daughter started having bad seizures at 18 and she really lost. She used to walk and everything and be very active and now she's in a wheelchair and care question is how much she will recover or what is your question about recovering? </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: About recovery after motor worsening or...? </p><p>Marta: Yes. After, yeah. </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: But the motor worsening was after seizure onset or...? </p><p>Marta:&nbsp;Yes I understand that she got worse and and yeah I may connect you later on with Encarnación but yeah she has been very worried because her daughter used to walk and be very functional and now she's in a wheelchair. </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: So there is always hope when something was in the past and it has been lost because of seizures because seizures can be treated. So we have some experiences with coming back to walk, coming back to talk and all of that with better seizure managing. So there is always hope if the problem is seizures, yeah. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Thank you there was one last question and it says: How important is genetic testing? Is it useful? </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: Yeah for sure! We need it. We need it. We need to perform genetic testing and all genetic testings are not created equal. So we need good genetic testing. So because now we have the problem that a lot of patients come to our clinic with genetic testing but you look at them and they are really bad testing. So we have to update the genetic testing each two or three years. So if you have a negative genetic testing, you you should repeat it after two or three years.&nbsp;</p><p>Marta:&nbsp;And linking to that question: what about we get parents that get the night EEGs and the MRIs for a long time after diagnosis. How often do you recommend that you get EEGs? And how often do you get MRIs or just the studying MRI and then no more? </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: So for MRI if it's SYNGAP1 or a genetic epilepsy...? </p><p>Marta:&nbsp;For SYNGAP1, yeah. </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: It's not necessary to repeat it. I would only repeat it if something really different happens. So in that situation I would repeat it but normally it's okay with one MRI. We don't need to repeat it. For EEG monitoring I would repeat it quite often. It could be once a year or once per six months or once per seizure change. So if you have a cognitive worsening, if you have a seizure change you should repeat an EEG. And as long as you can. One hour is better than 30 minutes. Two hours is better than 30 minutes. Four hours is better than two hours. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Thank you. I know you've got to go. Yeah so... </p><p>Marta:&nbsp;Thank you so much! </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: Thanks for having me. I'm sorry for my English. I know it's not so fluent but I try my best. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;This is great. This has really been valuable and I think a lot of families will watch it and benefit, so thank you. </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: Thank you all. Hope to see you soon. In person! </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Yeah and good luck with that trial. Anything we can do. That's an important trial. </p><p>Dr. Aledo-Serrano: Thank you Bye. </p><p>Marta: Thank you Ángel.<br></p>",

In 2005, she wrote ground-breaking autism insurance legislation for South Carolina (“Ryan’s Law”) that passed in 2007 and served as the catalyst for the national movement toward autism insurance reform.Following the passing of Ryan’s Law, Lorri worked at &nbsp;Autism Speaks where she served for more than a decade as Vice-President for State Government Affairs. Lorri oversaw advocacy initiatives in all 50 states and was responsible for spearheading the autism insurance reform movement, which led to 49 states requiring meaningful health insurance benefits for autism, including Applied Behavior Analysis coverage. In 2019 she became the CEO of the Council of Autism Service Providers which advocates for best practices in autism services.These are just a few highlights in Lorri’s long and celebrated career. In addition, she has founded the Unumb Center for Neurodevelopment which provides services to people with autism in South Carolina. She and her husband, Dan, wrote the first-ever comprehensive textbook on legal issues related to autism, entitled Autism and the Law. She has won numerous awards for her contributions to autism advocacy including the Autism Society of America 2008 Parents of the Year Award; the Behavior Analyst Certification Board’s Michael Hemingway Award; and the California Association for Behavior Analysis 2012 Leadership in Law Award.We could not be more thrilled to have such a high-impact speaker here with us today. About 50% of people who receive a SynGAP1 diagnosis will also receive a co-diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Lorri has spoken with Syngap Research Fund advocates in the past about advocating for proper treatment of our loved ones and is aware of the unique challenges we face as a community.</p>",

This is the SRF conversation on&nbsp; \"What does it mean to get diagnosed as a teenager?\"&nbsp; and we have on the screen Jo Ashline who lived through this and I'll let her tell her own story.&nbsp; We also have Rebecca and Olga who are Syngap directors and parents of Syngapian teenagers,&nbsp; which is a topic that is fascinating to those of&nbsp; us whose kids are not yet teenagers, so I think it'll be of interest to everybody. And Jo thanks for doing this. This whole idea came from you and me talking only a week ago about getting diagnosed and what does it mean to…. because I had&nbsp; just gotten off phone with another newly diagnosed&nbsp; parent of a teenager who'd spent her whole life&nbsp; being like \"I'm an autism mom,” \"I'm an epilepsy&nbsp; mom,” \"I'm an autism...\" and then suddenly at the age of, I don't remember, 15, 16, gets a diagnosis. And&nbsp; it's a very different conversation I have with those families and like, families who have like a three or five-year-old who gets diagnosed because then they're just like okay what's wrong with... or I know what's going on with my child: Syngap. Whereas you've already gone through that and&nbsp; now you're going through it again and trying to re-understand things. So I just think this would be&nbsp; fun to dig in on with somebody like you who is as articulate and as good at storytelling. So can I ask you to tell your story? Like, what's the story of Jo and Andrew's pre-Syngap diagnosis?&nbsp;</p><p>‍<strong>Jo: </strong>Okay perfect, so you know, Andrew was born at a time when even autism really wasn't discussed very often.&nbsp; We were lucky if we had a, you know, a news story every couple of weeks about a little blurb.&nbsp; And so, and certainly pre-social media as well, he was diagnosed in 2004 at the age of two.&nbsp; Literally about a week after his second&nbsp; birthday, a week later he collapsed in&nbsp; the front yard and was diagnosed with epilepsy. And so the two diagnoses were very quick. The&nbsp;&nbsp;autism, you know, we had suspected for a while that something was wrong. Back then pediatricians were pretty laissez-faire I would say about just trying to diagnose right away. It was a lot of, like, \"let's wait and see,\" \"he's a boy, boys talk later, “ \"I know he's not walking but let's wait&nbsp; until 18 months;\" and so I feel like we did lose... Early Intervention wasn't as prominent as it is now certainly. And so I feel like we did lose a couple of months of just going back and forth saying like \"hey, something's wrong\" and then we finally got... at 18 months we were referred to our local regional center, which in California is, you know, state-funded services and they can help&nbsp; you get diagnosed and then subsequently enroll you in therapies and so forth. So&nbsp;at the age of two we got the autism diagnosis. It wasn't surprising but it was still devastating, you know? I think there was a small part of us that always hoped we were wrong and&nbsp; that maybe it was something he would eventually outgrow and or that we could \"therapy away,\" you&nbsp;know. So he began early intervention services in our home right away at the age of two. We had&nbsp;&nbsp;two therapists coming back and forth five days a week. It was like go at that point. The diagnosis came and we were off and running and it was a bit of a whirlwind for sure. We&nbsp;definitely struggled with that as parents and as a family unit and just tried to find our new&nbsp;normal. There wasn't a whole lot of relief, let's say, like \"ah! we finally have a diagnosis.\" It was&nbsp;more of this incredible devastation and what does this mean for our child? And then of course&nbsp;the epilepsy right after that autism diagnosis was even more devastating because now we have this, you know. It's one thing to have a developmental delay and issues with communication and all this, but now we have this unknown horrendous medical complexity that we have to navigate and our kid is having drop seizures, you know, every two minutes in our home and in the yard. And suddenly the world is a million times more dangerous than it was the week prior. And so&nbsp; that was a really dark time for us. Like I said,&nbsp; we didn't feel any sort of relief from any of the&nbsp;&nbsp;diagnoses. There was no sense of like \"okay, now we get busy and we get to work and we heal our child.\"&nbsp; It was just a lot of crying and a lot of wine, you&nbsp; know, way before noon. It was a really tough time. And over the years, certainly, we began to make our peace, work towards acceptance.&nbsp; We built an amazing community around us that included our in-home therapists and our entire diagnostic and medical team. Friends, family, we were very lucky that we really had a large village from which to gather strength and support, both emotional and otherwise. And definitely fellow autism and epilepsy parents, you know. That was a huge part of that new community that we began to step into. And that helped us through that darkness and then we began to... you get kind of... not excited, but I guess it's almost contagious&nbsp; (not a great word right now during a pandemic (I realize that); but it's almost contagious when you are surrounded by other families who are operating from a place of hope. And so I think that's what we eventually did. We sort of joined the bandwagon of hope and we began finding a lot of autism organizations started popping up from the time Andrew was diagnosed to the time he was elementary age,&nbsp; elementary school age. So we just kind of had to pick and choose which organizations sort of fit our family mission and our mission for our child. And so we kind of became like \"à la carte\" foundation parents where we would pick and choose. We would have a little bit of this one and a little bit of that one and part of that. I think because we never fully aligned with just one.&nbsp; I think that can be really difficult. Our kids are so complex and so unique in a lot of ways.&nbsp; And I think also because we always knew there was more to Andrew's story.&nbsp;&nbsp;We just always knew that we didn't have the full scope of what was going on. And over the years we had numerous genetic tests done. And a lot of things were, you know, we were able to say \"no\". We were excluding a lot of stuff, but there weren't any other answers other than those exclusions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> So can I just double-click on a couple thing. You get the autism and the epilepsy diagnosis and you're sort of in both communities. I have a question there. Because like a lot of our parents now, our four-year-old was diagnosed with Syngap. So I was an autism, I was an epilepsy&nbsp; parent for nine months before I became a Syngap parent. I didn't have time to get attached to that, whereas you kind of had those two circles and I'm always curious about… Like, did you go to autism... was there much of an intersection of people who were like \"oh I have autism and epilepsy too\"?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>Yeah, oh yeah, I think there were, yeah. I mean it wasn't everyone by any means and that wasn't necessarily the focal point of some of the autism organizations we were part of and certainly autism wasn't a focal point of some of the epilepsy groups I was a part of, whether that was online or a foundation or whatnot. But yeah, there were definite intersections happening of the two because... I mean, there is a high rate of (and I can't give you statistics right now); but&nbsp;&nbsp;individuals with autism and epilepsy do exist and there's a lot of us, you know, so...&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mike: </strong>But did you find when you were talking to people who&nbsp; weren't in that intersection that didn't quite&nbsp; get it? Like the epilepsy people didn't&nbsp; get the autism part and the autism people didn't get the drop seizures?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo:</strong> Yeah absolutely. Listen, the challenges were very different and the approach&nbsp; to the child was very different. The approach to IEPs, education services, therapies, all of that;&nbsp; definitely there were differences and I think two priorities. I mean, there were times when Andrew's epilepsy was \"semi-controlled\" (it's never&nbsp; been controlled). The autism, the behaviors, those&nbsp;challenges really took priority and precedence. And then there were times when the epilepsy was severely out of control and we were hospitalized and changing medications and things were just, you know, falling apart around us. The autism was in the background so there was always this sort of back and forth between the two. And certainly in the midst of that, because Andrew's considered on the severe end, a level three autism diagnosis was what he's always had. You had the behaviors but also the global developmental aspect of it, those delays, those impairments. So&nbsp; there was a lot of just layers to it and it just depended on the circumstances with Andrew what was in the forefront at the time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mike: </strong>So okay, so you're neck deep in this. You've got hospitals. You've got epilepsy. &nbsp;You've got autism. You're dealing with it. You build a community. Can we talk just for a minute about&nbsp;who brought up genetic testing? How many genetic tests did you have? And how long did&nbsp;it take until you actually got the answer?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>So, I mean, genetic testing, from the very beginning I would say and just kind of every couple of years our providers... it was always our neurologist that really sort of took that part of Andrew's testing and stuff. They took the helm of genetic testing and then it just sort of went quiet for a while. I&nbsp; think we just kind of were like \"ah, maybe we've done all we can at this point\".&nbsp; And then we found ourselves leaving our local children's hospital. We just were really unhappy with Andrew's overall treatment there and sort of like the route that was going and we ended up, and he was getting older.&nbsp; So he was... other providers, other epileptologists were sort of opening up. He didn't have to just stick with a pediatric only. We ended up finding ourselves in Hoag at Newport Beach with Dr. Millet and we really liked him right away. It was a couple of months before he suggested we do a new round. He was like, \"listen, let's redo some tests. Let's just do some more tests. I would love to find out if there's something we can unearth about the cause of his epilepsy that can&nbsp; drive better treatment;\" and of course we were like \"absolutely!\" so we ended up doing that. And Andrew was 16, so I want to say it was like April or May of when he was 16 years old. So a few years ago. He just turned 19. And we got the call to come in and I just, it's just one of those moments where, you know, like in your life you have these pivotal moments you won't forget.&nbsp; And we sat in his office, Andrew was with us, and he just looked at us and said something came up and I just was like \"what!?\" I just, we were so accustomed to&nbsp; like, \"hm, we still don't know\", \"hm, we may never know, which we never wanted to hear but we just get used to it. And so when he said something came up and he just showed us, he handed me a printout. And, you&nbsp; know, all this medical mumbo-jumbo right, and he says \"He has Syngap\" and I was like what? You know, \"what the hell is Syngap?\" in true&nbsp; eloquence. And he started explaining it and, you&nbsp; know, \"we found a variant\". And I just remember it was the first and only time I had ever&nbsp; felt relief at a diagnosis without even knowing what the trajectory for Andrew and his development...&nbsp; what it meant. I just felt this overwhelming sense of relief because we had a picture&nbsp; of our child. And when he started, he was talking&nbsp; while I was reading and I just remember reading,&nbsp; just that, you know, they have like a paragraph or two on the printout they give you of Syngap&nbsp; and sort of the manifestations of symptoms. And it was for the very first time in our lives,&nbsp; it was like someone took Andrew and wrote him down. Almost to a T. From the way he held his hands, his gait, onset of delays, you know, non-speaking, all of the things that we had been kind of been like, \"wow, these are kind of outliers.&nbsp; I don't see other kiddos with autism displaying&nbsp; this\" and \"I don't see other kiddos with epilepsy\"&nbsp; and it was a relief. It was so... it's such a&nbsp; stark difference between that autism and epilepsy diagnosis where it was like pure devastation. This, the juxtaposition here was that I was, we were just,&nbsp; we looked at each other. My husband and I were&nbsp; like \"Oh my god. This is Andrew... we finally have&nbsp; an answer. We don't know what it means but we&nbsp; at least can go from here\", you know. So that was, that's something we'll never forget for&nbsp; sure.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>I was just gonna say I'm so happy that she had a neurologist that could speak to it in some capacity because&nbsp; when we got our diagnosis right before Autumn turned three, so for context she's 12.&nbsp; And basically our neurologist said here's some paperwork on what Syngap is. You're probably not&nbsp; going to understand most of what you read and you need to go see a geneticist. And that was it. So I'm happy your neurologist was able to at least extrapolate some of the data and give that to&nbsp; you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>Yeah, and you know, certainly he's no, I wouldn't say he's a Syngap expert by any means but I think he's the kind of doctor that wants to know more and I think he was pleasantly startled at&nbsp;&nbsp;our... I think it was motivating for him just to see our reaction. Maybe he was thinking like \"oh man,&nbsp; I gotta give some news today\" and we were like \"oh!&nbsp; thank you for finding something\" and I think he's since definitely tried to learn more. But I&nbsp; wouldn't say there was like a level of expertise&nbsp; by any means. We had to basically start, I'm sure like you, just kind of googling our way through until we started to find each other, you know.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mike: </strong>But so he's 16. &lt;Yeah.&gt; You read this. You feel heard. Let me just orient time. So one thing we didn't talk about... and maybe we can come back to, is if he's 16 you'd already began puberty? &lt;Oh, years before.&gt; So you're dealing with a puberty Syngapian. You've no idea what the heck is going on. You finally get diagnosed&nbsp; and that was how long ago? &lt;So, 16. He's 19. So&nbsp; three or... 2018. &nbsp;So... almost 3 years yeah...&gt; And I remember we probably got in touch like in the&nbsp; following year. And you... so I guess I have a lot of questions about this moment and the next 12 months because where we sit with SRF, we find the parents find us, right. As they get diagnosed they Google, they eventually find us and it's a very different conversation for me to&nbsp; meet a parent who is where you were than to meet a Rebecca, right. You got a three-year-old&nbsp; you get diagnosed, you're like \"I'm a Syngap parent\", okay, that's the normal conversation. But then I meet a Jo Ashline or, you know, the person I had spoken to last week and it's like: \"I used to be&nbsp; an autism, epilepsy person. Now I'm the Syngap person. I don't understand what the Syngap is. I don't even understand which club to belong to anymore or why I should belong to a club. Or&nbsp; like, I've made it this far, why should I care?\" And can you... I really am curious about sort&nbsp; of three things: a) your journey from 16 to now; b) help us understand, like, that identity crisis&nbsp; that I've said exists, because maybe I'm making it up.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>No, you're not, it exists!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mike: </strong>And then see what do parents who get a diagnosis... If there's a parent who's watching this right now or tomorrow who just got handed a piece of paper that says SYNGAP1 and they have a teenager, what do you want them to hear?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>Sure, so the identity crisis is very real. That sort of initial sense of relief at having this answer that we knew was out there eventually succumbed to a sense of confusion and a little bit of denial I think, as far as like having to reevaluate our child's sort of place in these communities we had been a part of and what that meant. And I would say that that has&nbsp; been ongoing. I don't think there is necessarily a resolution, nor am I really searching for one anymore. I sort of gave way to... just&nbsp; because I think I never... and I... people are very different. I never considered myself, you know, part of one community and this is my identity and \"I am an autism mom\" or an \"epilepsy mom\". I think what has helped me is that first and foremost, I am Andrew's mom. So wherever Andrew is, that is where my identity is.&nbsp; I'm his mom and no matter what comes about&nbsp; with regards to what he's going through,&nbsp; whether that's a diagnosis or an immediate health challenge that's my identity, in relation to him and not necessarily with any one&nbsp; you know organization or diagnosis. So&nbsp; that has helped me when I focus on Andrew&nbsp; and any time I've done that I've never been&nbsp; steered wrong. So I just have to constantly&nbsp; kind of come back to that as my anchor point&nbsp; because we do get ourselves... First of all, let's be honest. Raising kiddos with medical complexities or disabilities can be extremely isolating. Pandemic... before the pandemic. Okay, now you enter this new&nbsp; crazy world we've been living in the last year and that can make it even more so. And so it's natural for us to a) find communities&nbsp; with like-minded individuals and diagnoses because we want answers and we want a better life for our kids, but also there's a selfishness there that I think is healthy because we want to make friends. We want to be able to look at&nbsp; someone else and say \"I relate to you, you relate to me.\" That's a huge thing and it's an important part of self-care. It really is important in terms of&nbsp; mental health and feeling like you are part of&nbsp; something other than just this daily difficulty of raising our kiddos. And I say difficulty... that&nbsp; doesn't take away from the beauty of it. I want to make that disclaimer but it's important to have those relationships and be able to, you know...&nbsp; like, my most of my friends that I've had forever, they can't relate to me the same way that, like,&nbsp; parts of my community with special needs parenting can relate to me, you know. When I say that my 19 year old can't sleep through the night still and&nbsp; in a lot of ways I have a newborn in that regard. Like, my girlfriends are like \"we've been&nbsp; done with that for 18 and a half years\". And so that part of it I think is really important but&nbsp; at the end of the day that identity crisis for me as I've been working through it since his&nbsp; diagnosis, like I said, I always have to come back to my first identity as Andrew's mom.&nbsp; Anything outside of that that I find that I can relate to, or someone can relate to, is just icing on the cake for me. And in terms of, you know, \"Am I an autism mom?\" and \"Am I an epilepsy mom?\",&nbsp; \"Am I a Syngap mom?\" I'm all those things. I don't think that... that hasn't gone away. Andrew's&nbsp; autism symptoms and manifest... that hasn't gone away for us because we have a Syngap&nbsp; diagnosis and certainly the epilepsy has not gone away. Syngap has given us a reason and that has given me the freedom, the mental freedom, to a) let go of a lot of guilt that I had held&nbsp; on to as a parent, especially as a mom who gave birth to her little boy, who questioned&nbsp; every little thing I did. You know, prenatally and after delivery and all those things. Did I&nbsp; breastfeed enough? Did I do this enough? What did I take? Did I... you know, that has dissipated, which has&nbsp; been... that's a whole 'nother webinar the mom guilt, you know. That's been extremely liberating and that's opened me up to being able to be more present for my child. So there have been things&nbsp; that I didn't even expect that have come out of this Syngap diagnosis that I didn't realize were&nbsp; such a huge and heavy burdensome part of my life. But yeah, there's a, I think there's a const- listen, there's a constant turmoil going on like you know, do I still stay in this group? Am I still relevant here? Does this make sense?&nbsp; And also this sense of almost like&nbsp; because we were 16 when we came into Syngap you feel like an outsider where before you felt&nbsp; like you were, you know, part of the kind of, it's silly but like the cool kids club, right, where you're&nbsp; like in the middle of, like, you know, the jocks and the cheerleaders. Now you're like \"hey guys, um can I sit and have lunch with you? Do you think maybe?\"&nbsp; So it's kind of been all of it, you know. And like I said, I don't think there's any one resolution because I'm always just looking to Andrew to guide me. But I will say that my goal is to be more active in the Syngap community. I do think that it's taken me a little bit of time to kind of get to a place where I feel like I have something&nbsp; to say and that maybe it could help someone. And I keep telling myself just because we got the diagnosis late doesn't mean he hasn't had Syngap this whole time. And that's a big wake-up&nbsp; call for me because everything we've gone through has been Syngap. We may have heard a bunch&nbsp; of other things but it's still been Syngap so if you want to talk to me about puberty and&nbsp; about Syngap in puberty, just because I called it autism and puberty doesn't mean it wasn't Syngap and puberty but let's talk! I've been through it! What else do you want to know? IEPs? You know, what else? Let's do this thing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>I think that's a valid point, I mean, just your analogy of being with the kid coming in saying \"hey can I sit at your table?\" I think for a lot of us&nbsp; it's more like \"hey, look at that cool kid who just entered the group. We need to get to know that person. They know so much more than us. They have more years of experience. Like, \"hey come sit with us you know, you don't want to go over there, come sit with us, we're closer to puberty than them.\"&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>Interesting perspective right? Because you bring up a whole&nbsp; 'nother side of it that I wouldn't have thought about and where I feel behind is the research&nbsp; aspect of stuff, right? I mean listen, I'm educated. I know how to read research. I'm lucky in that way, but I feel, you know, when Mike is like out there and he's like \"we're doing this!\"&nbsp; and \"we're studying!\" and then I'm just like, you know, again, you want to talk about puberty? That's my specialty. That's what I know. You do that science part. We'll talk about behaviors, that's where I can help!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Mike is a freight train so it's going to be something new every week that he's like&nbsp;\"hey, we've got this going on\" and \"we figured this out\" and \"these people contacted us\" and \"this is what we're doing now,\" so keeping up is challenging. But just keep reading the newsletters because he updates everybody.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>Yeah and I think that's the part of it where I just have to forgive myself and just say I'm not supposed to... if i was supposed to know everything this would just be a one-man show and it's not supposed to be. We are supposed to collaborate right, as parents. And I&nbsp; know how powerful parents can be because I've seen it for the last, you know, 17 years of my son's life&nbsp;&nbsp;how parents are the ones who move mountains. We have changed the landscape of our&nbsp;public education system for our children. I mean,&nbsp; there's a lot still to be done but we've certainly&nbsp;moved mountains in ways that, you know, others haven't. And so I'm excited to see where where the Syngap community is going to make these&nbsp;enormous footprints, you know, for our kids and&nbsp;future kids, you know, and families.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mike: </strong>So let me throw two more questions at you and then everyone on this panel, everyone on this webinar right now is a parent, so if you've got questions&nbsp; guys just just chime in or if you want to jump up.&nbsp; So from where I sit after, you know, me the freight train who's obsessed, who is obsessively focused on the future because the way I think about the world: there's a lot of crazy science happening really fast and our kids, no matter what kind of therapy we create, the odds of our children being made neurotypical overnight are pretty low.&nbsp; The odds of our children being substantially helped by a therapy that improves levels of Syngap and therefore reduces behaviors issues, sleep issues, seizures, is serious. So when I look at the future I can't tell you which company or lab is going to do something, but in a few years I think it's reasonable to hope for trials of&nbsp; drugs that could meaningfully change our kids’ lives, right? So when I look at that future I think about how do I make sure that Syngap gets into&nbsp; that process and part of that is selling Syngap&nbsp; and we're underdiagnosed and that's all true so&nbsp; that's easy; but part of that too is is getting&nbsp; the patient community ready for trials and that means organized, that means in Ciitizen, that&nbsp; means all that stuff, right. &lt;Right.&gt; So while I&nbsp; totally appreciate you're Andrew's mom first and you have all these other identities,&nbsp; from where I sit, it is useful for people to say&nbsp; a) I'm, in addition to being my kid's mom, and&nbsp; an epilepsy parent and autism parent, also I am a Syngap parent and therefore I care about what happens to the Syngap community. And we're ready to organize&nbsp; them. But I also need people to believe that what I just said is true, right. That there's&nbsp; crazy science happening right now and things can actually get better because I feel like the&nbsp; longer you've been with your kid and this is me with a seven-year-old so I'm just taking the&nbsp; past three years of my life. The harder it is to imagine something could change because, and&nbsp; you've been with Andrew now for 19 years. So you're&nbsp; like Mike, are you really going to tell me that someone's going to make something that we put inside Andrew and it's going to radically change&nbsp; his seizure profile? So how do I... I mean just that's just a question to you like... right... how how do I&nbsp; reach out to parents who are getting diagnosed teenager and beyond and introduce this idea... not&nbsp; convince them, I'm not going to convince anybody; but introduce this idea that hey this diagnosis&nbsp; is not just a relief because now your kid is heard and you're heard but it opens the door to a lot of&nbsp; opportunities. How do we... what's the smartest way to&nbsp;&nbsp;have that conversation and meet people where they are?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>I mean, I think this is a great not to get... I think this is a great start. I think you appeal to families like me. I think you really touched upon an important thing and certainly when I say I'm Andrew's mom&nbsp; first, that definitely does not take away from the feeling that you know Syngap is a part of our&nbsp; lives and we we want to see the Syngap community, you know, find treatments and help all of these&nbsp; kids, you know, no matter their age group. But you did touch upon something that I think is relevant&nbsp; in that it is really hard to look at Andrew at 19 years of age and imagine that there is&nbsp; a treatment beyond what we've already done. Most of which has been, aside from the epilepsy&nbsp; interventions, most of which has been focused on behavioral interventions. That there is something&nbsp; meaningful that can change for him from a medical standpoint because of a scientific intervention.&nbsp; Now I certainly believe it to be true for&nbsp; the younger generations. I guess for part of our&nbsp; acceptance process all these years that now we&nbsp; have to kind of undo a little bit right is to&nbsp; say we're going to work with what we have. Yes I&nbsp; feel like my son can make incredible progress in all of these areas and I will always be his fiercest advocate. I will never stop believing&nbsp; in him but also I have to make peace with the&nbsp; fact that we probably won't ever see xyz. Now the challenge is, and it is a challenge, to kind of let a little light in where we've shut the blinds which is to say \"hey, you know that thing that we&nbsp; accepted before so that we can move forward with our lives and like get to the next level here?&nbsp; I think maybe we should go back and revisit that&nbsp; because science is showing me, Mike is showing me, SynGAP Research Fund is showing me, that there's some hope there yet\" and that can be&nbsp; hard and beautiful and hard, you know. So that's&nbsp; part of it. I think you start with discussions like this. You start with parents like me who can&nbsp; then reach out to other families of kids who are diagnosed not just as teens but young adults and&nbsp; adults and just say \"why not?\" \"Why can't we think bigger?\" \"Why can't we think better?\" and certainly&nbsp; that's I think a solid place to start but like you said you won't convince people. I think the&nbsp; convincing will be with the work itself, right.&nbsp; And then the second part of it is&nbsp; continuing to build upon the community like letting that light in for people who&nbsp; have kind of had... because it is really tricky&nbsp; a big part of why I'm able to show up for my kid&nbsp; every day is because I'm not sitting here yearning&nbsp; every second of every day for the things that&nbsp; aren't happening, like, you know, stimulating conversations back and forth that I would&nbsp; have with my 17 year old, right? Um, not that those conversations are stimulating, I mean, he's&nbsp; 17. They're more like one word grunts. But still,&nbsp; you know, part of being able to be&nbsp; there for Andrew in many ways and be able to&nbsp; show up for him is to not constantly be living in \"why not?\", \"why can't he?\", \"why, why, why?\" and so&nbsp; it is trying to... it is like a mental acrobatics&nbsp; to try to get to a place where it's like okay I'm&nbsp; still gonna make peace with where we're at but now I'm going to have some more hope because Mike's telling me to have more hope and&nbsp; there could be something to this, right.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>So I wonder about the challenge as far as it comes down to getting patient families who are older involved and their willingness to be involved so to say&nbsp; that, you know, we're not living, breathing, needing and relying on the fact that something can&nbsp; change in some capacity we need that message to get out there because when it comes time, that data is important. Having, you know, these children or young adults in these studies is so valuable and important. So how do you change potentially a mentality, and not necessarily change, but evolve a mentality that says \"I don't need something else. I've accepted at this point this is life\"&nbsp; to \"I'm open to see what those possibilities are?”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>Well and I think that there's going to be a&nbsp;percentage of people that won't, right. I just&nbsp;&nbsp;think that hope can be very frightening for people who have hoped for a long time and&nbsp;nothing really came of it, right, and they got to a&nbsp; place where they're like \"I just cannot keep hoping to this extent and continue to be letting down,\"&nbsp; whether that's because of uncontrollable seizures... and&nbsp; obviously we're talking about people who have been&nbsp; in the long game for a long time, right. This it's a... and we all don't have the same mental health either. Some people I think&nbsp;are more resilient naturally and some people&nbsp; really have to work at it or maybe aren't at all&nbsp;and it just really depends. So I think there's always going to be a percentage of people... and&nbsp;change can be scary even if it's good, right. Change&nbsp; can be really scary but then I think there's&nbsp;parents like me who... I... my first thought wasn't&nbsp; \"oh my god, what are we going to do for Andrew&nbsp; now that we know he has Syngap\", right? I mean&nbsp; it's been really complicated for us and we don't&nbsp; have enough time nor do you want to hear all of&nbsp; that. But I am now at a place and so is my husband,&nbsp; where we're like hey man, there's I think there's&nbsp; something to this. How can we help? What can we do?&nbsp; Yes, this is our community and like&nbsp; I said, you could call it whatever you&nbsp;want but this whole time it's been Syngap.&nbsp; That's been a big part of it too, you know.&nbsp; So I would say that certainly, I'm more than happy&nbsp; to be part of that conversation for other families&nbsp;&nbsp;who may be facing the same thing. If that's one&nbsp; way I can be of service to the Syngap community&nbsp; is to connect with families who are feeling&nbsp; that way, who are experiencing that similar hesitancy, then I'm all in for that, you know.&nbsp; That's something that I'm more than happy to do but I think it's gonna take some advocacy, you know. It's kind of like when Mike posts about Ciitizen and stuff and he's like guys like we need just seven people. Let's do this thing! Like,&nbsp; tell me why you're worried, tell me what, you know, and start those conversations.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>I just had a tangent question. As far as older kids and acceptance&nbsp;&nbsp;and being a part of these other communities: Autism, epilepsy, and there becomes a reluctance&nbsp; to continue to look for a reason why and we know that we're a significantly under-diagnosed&nbsp; population. So do you engage in conversations within those other communities to say hey guys...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>I have started much more, yeah. And I think that's an excellent question. Absolutely. In fact, I had someone ask me this morning after I posted about the webinar just kind of sharing like, hey.&nbsp; Yeah, I've definitely been like listen, here's a question to ask your neurologist if you think that your kiddo fits this kind of criteria. If you still don't have an answer, if you still are wondering... but I can definitely be doing more of that absolutely and that's important. I think that's a really&nbsp; important question, yeah.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Olga: </strong>Jo, I love how it's only been three years and you're doing a lot, so feel good about that.&nbsp; My son is 13 and we've... seven years now I guess. We were one of the first to be&nbsp; diagnosed, at least I think in the U.S. Rebecca, you were ahead of us. But Drew was 5 and we'd been&nbsp; searching for a year and a half and our label was PDD, Pervasive Developmental Delay.&nbsp; So you're doing an amazing job so keep&nbsp; it up. My question to you as the mom of a teen or an early teen, is which of these years are the most difficult behaviorally? Are we looking at early teens, mid-teens, late teens?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>Yeah so, I mean, that is a tough question to answer. We had a massive outlier situation with Andrew&nbsp; that I hope no one ever experiences. He was abused&nbsp; by his fifth grade teacher and, you know, being non-speaking he obviously couldn't come home and&nbsp; tell us and so he, at that age, began... I mean he went from a kiddo who loved the school bus to a kiddo who was screaming when he would see the school bus. I'm not going to get into all that. You're welcome to google it. It's all over the internet, you know, what we went through. But that sort of threw a wrench in being able to tell&nbsp; a typical trajectory of behavior issues because&nbsp; he went from some behaviors to a completely different child. Ended up being diagnosed with PTSD, which is you can imagine very difficult to do with a kiddo like Andrew, and a lot of trauma that we're still unraveling until&nbsp;&nbsp;now and that really lent itself to a whole 'nother level of behaviors. We're really lucky to have an incredible in-home team and and a pediatrician and just our whole village. But unfortunately that prevents me from really being able to give you like a typical... not that I don't think there is a typical I will say this. I will&nbsp; say... and I know Mike and I spoke about possibly doing something regarding puberty which we are still in the midst of... but puberty does cause an increase oftentimes in behaviors.&nbsp; I mean, listen, it causes an increase in behaviors and neurotypical individuals, let's just be&nbsp; honest, okay. Like, we're all a mess during puberty. Some of us never outgrow it. So imagine, right, you either can't talk or you have, you know, some people have onset of seizures during puberty.&nbsp; Sometimes for the first time. Sometimes new seizures can come on during puberty. All of that's been well documented in many studies and so there's a lot of different&nbsp; things. But the truth is, no matter what's going on cognitively, the hormones are still flying, guys, and the body is still responding and so that&nbsp; stuff definitely needs to be addressed. Not nearly&nbsp; enough resources on this topic. It's sorely misunderstood and I think parents are scrambling&nbsp; and don't know what to do and educators as well,&nbsp; right. So this is an area I'm also really&nbsp; passionate about and we're still in the thick&nbsp; of it and definitely I don't have a clear cut&nbsp; solution, only to say, you know, it's the long&nbsp; game. Weather the storm. Yeah, but I think, listen,&nbsp; what really helped us and Andrew's abuse actually was what really changed this for me, is you know when you look at typical behaviorism a lot of it is like denied access and you know there's like&nbsp; the four pillars of behavior and what's&nbsp; missing often is how our kids are feeling. Yeah. You&nbsp; know what I mean, like, what is... I know we look at antecedents; like okay Andrew wanted a bounce&nbsp; house, he didn't get one, now he's banging his head.&nbsp; That's easy, okay. That's an easy one. But there's times where our kids just don't feel good and can't tell us or they're scared or feeling anxiety or getting abused by a teacher and we don't know. And that's an extreme case. But what it forced us to do as parents is to look at his ABA program and be like, guys there's a whole section here that's missing about our children and what else is causing. That's not all just tangibles. It's not all just like \"I want this and I can't have it,\" \"I want to go there and you won't let me.\"&nbsp; Our kids are complex. They're just like you and I.&nbsp; They just don't have the means to express it, right?&nbsp; Like if I'm in pain, or I'm afraid, I'm gonna resort&nbsp; to basic survival instincts and it's not pretty.&nbsp; I mean, our kids are operating most of the time on that level of&nbsp; existence. Communicating the feelings is very&nbsp; difficult. It's very difficult and I think just, you know, we're oftentimes, our kids are reduced...&nbsp; I think most providers and educators mean well, but I think the problem has been our kids have been reduced to a piece of paper and a chart and there's so much more going on a lot of times. And it's hard to dig it, but once you start to understand that, I think you look at&nbsp; the behavior a little bit differently. We've seen a massive reduction... pandemic has definitely... you know, he's probably super sick of us right now. We are very boring compared to the outside world.&nbsp; He's like, over it, but I'll tell you this: if we can reduce behaviors, I really&nbsp; believe anyone can because we were at the like,&nbsp; we were at the cliff. Basically.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> You have in-home ABA?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>I mean we haven't for a while and that was actually... we ended up... you know he was in in-home ABA, that's a whole 'nother thing, for 14&nbsp; years; and after the Syngap diagnosis I wanted&nbsp; some time to process so I, actually we ended it. Andrew was getting to a point where he was so&nbsp; overly scheduled. He's in an ABA-based school. The entire program is ABA, although they're&nbsp; very progressive, which is why I love it. And that was more than enough at that point. Because he&nbsp; was coming home after 3:30 and then having therapy till almost 7:00, like, hi when does Andrew get to be Andrew? Like, at what point? And that's&nbsp; another thing I'm passionate about too is therapy is important. Intervention can be priceless but&nbsp; also our kids need some time to just be themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Olga: </strong>I think that's a very important point you just brought up because we've just gone through that with Drew where we have cut back a lot on the after school therapies and because he just,&nbsp; he was refusing to go. I mean, he was just too tired. The therapists were suggesting that it's time to take a break. So I think that's....&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>Well, I think you step back and you say what is my end goal here and what am I willing to do to my kid or for my kid to get there? So our end goal... we&nbsp; weren't meeting that goal at all... and then we had to reevaluate that goal. Like, what is it that we're looking for for him, you know? But I say that after 14 years guys, in-home ABA. I'm not suggesting it to anyone to like up and quit something. These therapies can be, when conducted ethically and&nbsp; properly and with the individual child in mind, can be priceless sources of support, you know, and change. So please don't take us stopping to mean&nbsp; like everyone should up and quit their program. That is not what I'm saying. We have,&nbsp; you know...&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mike: </strong>I think the broader point&nbsp; is, you know, in what you just said right. Our kids can be over-scheduled. Therapy's super important, get as much as you can. Our kids can be over&nbsp;&nbsp;scheduled. Give them time to be kids, you know. Accept your kid and be present for them and love them, but understand that things can change. And do what you can, like sign up for Ciitizen, and&nbsp; share your data so we can understand this disease. There's a lot of these conflicting ideas that you have to have in your head at the same time as a Syngap parent because... I don't, I'm not an expert in other rare diseases&nbsp; but I have yet to hear about, or in discussion&nbsp;with other rare leaders learn about, a rare&nbsp; disease where the kids are as complicated&nbsp;you know. Like our kids.... some of these kids they have tumors, they have really consistently horrific seizures;&nbsp; whereas we have some kids who have horrific seizures and some kids less so. But I feel like Syngap is \"death by a thousand cuts\" right. A little bit of autism, a&nbsp; little bit of epilepsy, a little bit of sleep,&nbsp; a little bit of hypotonia. None of your doctors are talking to each other so only when you talk to another Syngap parent does somebody say&nbsp; \"yeah, this is a complete and unadulterated SS\" and you you just need to... this is a serious medical condition, but because you're having... because&nbsp; you're treating eight different symptoms with 10 different specialists and one pediatrician who's like \"I... you have the biggest medical file I've ever seen. I have no idea\" you know.&nbsp; It's crazy making until you actually talk to&nbsp; other Syngap parents and I think this is obviously, as somebody who's quit my job and now works on Syngap advocacy all day long right, I can't not want everyone to at some level identify as a Syngap parent because... and this is kind of why I want to help people not abandon their other identities but add this&nbsp;badge to their shirt because I feel like the best people to support Syngap parents are other Syngap parents. Because no one else understands that you're giving an epilepsy med to somebody who woke you up at 4:00 a.m. and you're protecting the sibling from an act of aggression while wondering is it OT or PT today? Like, that was basically my morning, you know.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>Yeah, I mean I'll give you an example just kind of piggybacking what you said as far as not understanding. So I just recently had surgery. I had to have a hip replacement and even, you know, I was terrified of the surgery itself but my our biggest concern in the house was like how is Andrew gonna adjust to not having this sort of unlimited access to me and having to rely on other people, which we're so lucky to have helping us during this time. So the route we took was instead of like how are we going to accommodate the patient which is typical; how are we going to accommodate Andrew so that the household has the least amount of changes because that's gonna affect the family unit as a whole and allow me to rest. We had to plan everything with him first right? And only another Syngap parent can understand that kind of mentality where you're like, where I sleep is actually going to be based on where Andrew needs to sleep, what I'm&nbsp; going to do is actually based on what Andrew needs at any given time of day, and that's kind of how&nbsp; we go through our through our life, right... it’s like the Syngapian and then everything else because that's what makes the&nbsp; family unit work.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mike: </strong>Rebecca do you want to say anything or is it a little too raw right now?</p><p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>About this? No, I think it's correct and it really takes a village. You know, we're a divided family so Autumn's dad really stepped up as well as her uncle and aunt to help while I was in hospital and doing surgery. But to your point,&nbsp; she doesn't understand that mom's not as accessible as she used to be so... you know, she still grabs and pulls and does all the things&nbsp; that she's supposed to do. And her stepdad is like \"no, no don't grab mom; you can't touch mom;&nbsp; come to me,\" and I'm constantly saying you need to go talk to ___, go talk to __, and she just doesn't&nbsp; understand.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>I'll show you what we did years ago that has come in handy. And of course, probably if the fire&nbsp; department saw it we'd be in trouble. One of the things we did because Andrew flooded our&nbsp;kitchen in the middle of the night... I want to&nbsp; say now it was like five or six years ago... super&nbsp;dangerous, not fun to clean up. My husband and my other son built this gate. So it's like… because you can't buy this. Like you can't buy an “Andrew Gate,” by the way. We tried; they don't make it. So what we did is: They built that gate. They painted it to look colorful. And that gate separates him from the main part of the living room and the kitchen and all that. And so that gate is the only reason I've been able to rest at night. I slept on the couch during my&nbsp;recovery while he stayed on that side of the gate. Because what Andrew loves to do is come in&nbsp; the middle of the night and roll on top of me, which is not great during a hip replacement recovery. So my husband's been amazing keeping him... But that gate, that's the only reason I've been able to sleep is that gate. And trust me when I say he tries to open it. We've had to make tons of modifications right. But this is the kind of stuff only Syngap parents can understand.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Does he climb it? Does he try and get his legs over? No he can't. It's way too tall. And that's why they made it super tall, super thick, super durable, and he's just not strong enough to climb to begin with. He's not a huge climber, yeah. &lt;Gotcha yeah.&gt; I mean, you know he can be strong during behaviors, but climbing is not really his thing. But yeah, I mean, that's the thing. You show a gate like that to a neighbor, they're like \"what? what are you doing?\"&nbsp; And I show it to you guys and you're like \"where can I get one?\" right? “and how many?,” “and do they come in other colors?” Like that's just... But anyway, yeah. So I just kind of wanted to speak to that too, right. When we talk about Syngap. I don't know what's going on with you but my goodness that does look uncomfortable. I hope you're healing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>This is my security blanket right now. So I had cervical fusion.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>Okay I saw that. I did see that on Facebook, yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Yeah so all good, thank you though. You know, but our kids definitely don't&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>understand. They don't understand sickness, injury. I mean none of it. And it's, you know, you need to do what I need you to do right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>You have a migraine? I'm sorry, I don't care. Vertigo? The flu? You know, they're like get on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>24-7 mom, no matter what. No sleep.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>No and it doesn't, it doesn't and you know. Listen, the other part of that is that it doesn't just go away. Like when, you know, my 17-year-old, he's going to be off to college in September. He&nbsp;does his own laundry, he can make a snack or cook a meal. You see the progression in your kids&nbsp; developmentally when they're neurotypical, but for us certainly we celebrate every milestone&nbsp;and every new skill, but it looks very different. And we know that, you know. It’s another thing to constantly be dealing with. And it resurfaces when friends' kids meet new milestones or like my son Ian is going to be graduating high school and, you know, Andrew didn't get that same opportunity. And that stuff comes out, right? Even if you have spent 17 years working on acceptance. It's inevitable that that comes to the surface and you have to address it. Otherwise, nothing good comes of not, right? So then you find your tribe and you talk and you say this sucks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mike: </strong>That's a whole other thing. We talked about this. We have a weekly family meeting and that's the general... but I'm starting to see that we could&nbsp; subgroup it. The grief comes up, right? The&nbsp; grief of... you don't grieve and move on because life and kids keep growing, so there's new triggers all the time and sometimes you just need to... I can't remember who said this, but sometimes you just need to...&nbsp; -there was a parent who went to something that was triggering, you know, and had to talk with a bunch of parents of neurotypical kids about stuff that for them was abstract, but for us was very real. And this parent talked about driving home with Nirvana cranked up and just screaming and crying the whole way home.&nbsp; Because you don't know what's gonna trigger you and that was like... and everyone on the screen was like yep, totally.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>I mean my nephew who's 3 triggers me. I love him so much, he's amazing. And he's been an amazing source of socialization for Andrew because he's over here all the time. Our families are in our pandemic pods, so to speak, so we're always together. And he's the oldest of my sister's three kids and he's already surpassed Andrew, not just verbally but in a million different ways developmentally. You know, he's stronger than him, he's faster than him. Obviously he can talk. He understands most things that Andrew doesn't. So that's been a double-edged sword. Like on the one hand, I love the relationship. It's beautiful and they have all of the same interests right now like cars and Thomas the Train. But this is one more person in his life that's already surpassed him, you know, and that is triggering. And I have to just kind of deal with that as wel,l sometimes on just a daily basis when he visits, and just go, that's okay. You know it's part of this. And it's okay to say that. There is no, like I said, there's no resolution, there's just processing, right?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>With Andrew being 19 have you already filed for guardianship?</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>Yes. So we had our hearing. Yes, so ideally... and this is another great topic. But ideally,&nbsp;especially in California, we were told like six months prior to the 18th birthday and now with the pandemic I think a lot of things have definitely changed.&nbsp; So we filed. We ended up using an&nbsp; attorney just because I wanted to do it right; but I know plenty of families who've done it themselves. There are resources and yeah that was a whole other thing.&nbsp; We're really grateful we have it in place.&nbsp; He's got a conservatorship. We actually had our hearing January of 2020. So typically the hearing will be before... Ours was before he turned 18... so the actual conservatorship didn't get put in place until after his 18th birthday. Now in California I believe they're doing them virtually due to the pandemic and there was already&nbsp; a backlog when we were doing it, so if you're approaching that age at all I would urge you to at least start thinking about it, finding out your state's local resources. If you want to go the attorney route, sort of, you know, deciding how much that costs and so forth, I know state by state has their own different sort of system in place. But we have relief with that, you know,&nbsp; and we have the main ones which are medical,&nbsp; financial, contract, educational, all of that, yeah, because there's several.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>You have one or two that's older than Andrew?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>Younger. 18 months younger, so he's the oldest.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>So Andrew's the oldest and Ian's 17. And he's graduating and I assume he's going to college?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>He is. We're just waiting for all the choices to come in. We're still deciding, yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>How do you propose that you're going to prepare Andrew for him leaving home?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>So I don't think, you know, cognitively Andrew's not really going to understand&nbsp; the extent of that. He loves Ian. Ian is his bestest friend in the world. But as Ian's gotten older the relationship has changed because Ian has not been as available, you know, because of the nature of his life, which is he plays varsity&nbsp; baseball. He has AP classes. He has a girlfriend. He has friends. So that's a whole ‘nother thing. Whereas before there was a lot more opportunity for them to have that time. Ian has naturally through (I mean it's not his fault), he has a lot... he gets a life too. For us as a family, though, we try to always have balance. And our goal is that as Ian takes flight,&nbsp; that he will always remember where his roots are. And I think part of our big mission with him was that we didn't want to raise a child that would end up being resentful of the circumstance, so we always made sure he had his own stuff. And then we always made sure he had stuff that he and his brother shared. It was like we were in a constant... and that's a constant state of flux, right? You're constantly trying to reevaluate what that looks like for your family. I know I kind of went off topic. That's another passionate thing of mine.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>I think there's so many different ways the conversation can diverge. My brain is going to: Okay, Andrew's a teenager. What are you doing for gifts because I just feel like I should wrap up all of the presents and re-gift them because that's all she likes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>Honestly Rebecca, you do what is relevant to your kids. So, you know, for us in therapy they spent so many years in the beginning and we kind of bought into a lot of this stuff too, like age-appropriate, age-appropriate, age-appropriate... -and it's Andrew appropriate. That's it. It's Andrew appropriate. If he wants to play with Thomas the Train until he's 90, who cares? You know? Who is that hurting? What is it that I want for him in his life? That's the other thing. If&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>he suddenly develops an interest in bird watching,&nbsp; great. We'll splurge on that. Like, it doesn't matter.&nbsp; Whatever is Andrew appropriate. And so if that's what makes sense for you and your kid then I'm all for it. Andrew, you know, it's bounce houses,&nbsp; inflatables, dot markers. There's always something.&nbsp; And we love Amazon and Amazon loves us. But, you know, you do what works for your kid.&nbsp; That's just, I guess... I don't know. I'm a big hippie about that stuff. I'm just like, if it makes my kid smile... Life's already so frickin’ hard for him, and honestly by extension for us, that you know I just... whatever I can do to make it better, that's what we do.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> No, I think that's really smart Jo. I think that, you know, I keep wanting to clear out all these toys, but that's... &lt;Send them my way!&gt; It's not happening. And in the past, he's seen me, you know, gather stuff up and he'll come take it out of the box.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>Yeah, I just, you know, and I think... listen, it's personal too.&nbsp; I'm not trying to tell anybody what to think, but that's worked for us and it's given me so much peace and it makes room. It gives me the strength to deal with the big stuff… What I consider to be the big stuff, you know? Trying to get him to a place of age-appropriate play? What does that look like for Andrew? It is&nbsp; appropriate what he's doing. And he's happy and he's thriving. When he's doing that, then I have the spoons... I don't know if you're familiar with the spoon theory, but you can Google it. Then I have the spoons to deal with the other stuff, like the epilepsy and the other crap that infiltrates his life and our life,&nbsp; you know. So that's just... and that's probably just the old-timer in me honestly. Like 17 years in and there's just some things where I'm like that doesn't phase me, uh so no. There's a little bit of freedom with that, you know.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Olga: </strong>One quick question. Just going back to the&nbsp; behavior aspect. And I know you all had some&nbsp; different circumstances unfortunately. When we spoke with Dr. Michaud in Montreal, his experience and of course of those that he had the opportunity to treat at the time, he felt that as they got older they were mellowing out more. And I just didn't know if you'd experienced some of that mellowing a little bit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>Yeah I think so, and it's hard to know what has contributed to that, you know. I mean I don't think he's by any means done with puberty from what we can tell and and so, you know, we're kind of still in the middle of it. But yeah, I mean, we definitely have seen... and think too as we've changed, I think it's honestly there's so many variables going on, especially if you have&nbsp; things like therapy in place and your mindset changes and you're taking care of yourself. And I think there's an extension of all that. It all plays a role. But I would hope to believe that's true. I think, Jesus, if anyone deserves a break with age it's our kids and our families. So it'd be great to have some light at the end of that tunnel, right?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Olga: </strong>Yeah, I think, you know, hopefully as they get older they start to be... Well, they become more accepting of how things are possibly. And that's kind of what I think they've been seeing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo</strong>: That's the hope, right? Andrew's school when he was attending before the pandemic&nbsp;was a huge source of reduction in behavior. When you have an amazing program&nbsp; that is driven by the right mission and executed by the right people who are in it for the right reasons, that is day and night in terms of success for your kids and your family. So that is my biggest piece of advice. It is invest in those IEPs, in those placements, because they make one of the biggest impacts on your kid's life and therefore your life. I mean, it is really important to know where you're sending your kid and who is delivering services and why.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Yes. One question&nbsp; that we have kind of going back a little bit is how did you get Andrew to play with toys? So, I mean, I know I experienced this when Autumn was super young. Getting her to engage and want to&nbsp; play with things. But, you know, at what point in Andrew's development did he gain that interest and how did you encourage it with him?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>Yeah, I think play is kind of a, you know… How do you define how he plays? So he was always interested in stuff. Primarily his interest has always been cause and effect, which is why, you know, the iPad has been such a huge success here in our house. But he just... I think he, you know, he had a brother that played with him.But Andrew doesn't necessarily play appropriately&nbsp; with everything so he's not like... When I say Thomas the Train, he loves Thomas the Train on YouTube videos. He loves the episodes. He loves scripting.&nbsp; So he approximates a lot of his favorite stuff,&nbsp; but he wants us to repeat. So it's not what you would consider typical play. But then he loves, like, if we build the track and have the actual same trains as the episode, so kind of what we did&nbsp; is we built connections. When we saw him show an&nbsp; interest in a specific video or cartoon, we would&nbsp; try to bring it to life basically and make those connections. Then I would say somewhere around 13 he started developing an interest in, like, art supplies, which was so cool because forever we were like ah, it would be so neat if he&nbsp; would just draw or, you know, scribble or whatever; and he just suddenly took a loving to it and he started doing the walls. And we were like, whatever, he loves it. Honestly, that's what you get like after a certain amount of time. You&nbsp; just go, whatever works, dude. So he would sit in the hallway and that was like his designated wall space and he would just take dot markers and just kind of do it up. And that was his spot.&nbsp; He loved it. And the floors, but they would wipe off. And then we kind of got him onto paper and&nbsp; slowly off the walls and it just evolved, you know. But I think what we do is we see an interest and, like I said, we try to bring it to life, you know. And it usually now will&nbsp; start with some kind of YouTube video.&nbsp; But he was always interested in cause and&nbsp; effect. So that kind of made it easy when we would buy a little mini keyboard or one of those&nbsp; things like a marble run. Anything like that always gained his attention. So we would just kind of go&nbsp; with it, you know. But, a lot of modeling. And then school, they focused on a lot of turn taking and playing with peers and games, but&nbsp; that's not his thing. He likes the cause and effect&nbsp; and that. So, again, it's one of those things&nbsp; that's probably pretty individual. And of course, you know, he loves Cars, Disney Cars, so he has all the Disney Cars, like that kind of stuff, right? So yeah. Oh and the other thing we started doing was he has these favorite characters that he&nbsp; loves so I started ordering like big giant poster board pictures of them and he just&nbsp; like, you know, we just kind of, you have to just kind of get creative. Like he loves, you know, Harold&nbsp; the Helicopter so he has a huge poster&nbsp; of Harold the Helicopter and he can, like, dot marker it or stare at it or snuggle it, whatever.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mike: </strong>This is great. I'm gonna to ask each one&nbsp; of you... I'm gonna wrap it up after I say something... and I'm gonna ask each one of you to just, if there is a parent watching this and they just got diagnosed with a teenager, what should they keep in mind? I'm going to ask you all to answer that, but I just want to come back to... There were a lot of great one-liners in this Jo. I'm going to have to re-watch it to pull them out, but I like the \"cool kids table.\" I feel like rare disease land is nothing but a bunch of people looking at other people being like God,&nbsp; how do they do it? That's all we're doing. Because when I look at this screen I see two moms who are&nbsp;some of the first diagnosed and are still standing and still full of grace and composure and working their butts off for our community. Yeah. I&nbsp; look at you Jo and I think about all that you've gone through before you knew it was Syngap and I can't understand. I just don't understand that because I've basically&nbsp; always known it was Syngap and then, you know, some people are like how does Mike&nbsp; know all this stuff and Mike's just constantly saying the same thing. It's not like I know&nbsp; anything. I'm just like: sign up for Ciitizen. Science is coming. There's this many companies. I have very standard talking points and don't know that anyone thinks that I'm cool,&nbsp; but I do know that I’ve spent a lot of time connecting parents who are both like wow they were amazing and I feel like that's the heart of this right? Like we could all spend hours talking about the ridiculous challenges and stupidities and failures of the medical system and dumb things that neurologists sometimes say. -Not that all neurologists say dumb things all the time. But they all have their moments. But I think the most important thing is these conversations, right? Where parents can validate each other's experience and answer each other's questions. And I'm constantly amazed at the parents who are trying to do this solo and aren't connecting. I just,&nbsp;I don't know how they're doing it, honestly. But thank you Jo for being willing to do this and&nbsp;for sharing all of these great... &lt;Thank you. Thanks for having me.&gt; pieces of wisdom. And I think it's an important conversation because we're going to have hundreds and thousands of teenagers diagnosed in the coming years and we need to figure out how to connect with those families. So on that&nbsp; note, thank you Jo, thank you Rebecca, thank you Olga. And one minute each I'm going to time you. &lt;Uh oh!&gt; We'll start with Jo. I'm going to cut you off in 60 seconds . I set my timer up here. You're a parent of a teenager with Syngap and you've just got the piece of paper. What do you need to hear? Go.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>Well, first of all, there's way more information out there already than there was three years&nbsp;ago when we got the diagnosis and so I would speak to the fact that this is a very fast-paced process in terms of gaining awareness and access to research. You don't have to do it alone&nbsp;and don't do it alone, you know? Don't worry about the diagnosis, the actual name and all of that.&nbsp; Find your people, use the diagnosis to get connected. Go slow but go, you know? I think that's&nbsp; at the heart of it. If you're feeling like you are a man with no island, there's a really big island waiting for you and a lot of people&nbsp; I think are gonna struggle with that identity crisis we spoke to earlier. But on the other side of that is as a new community of hope and help and resources. And you may be an expert on a subject&nbsp; that a younger Syngap family really needs to hear about. So there's two sides of that, you know?&nbsp; You can get resources and you can be a resource.</p><p><strong>Mike: </strong>Awesome. Thank you Jo.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jo: </strong>You didn't&nbsp; even have to cut me off.</p><p><strong>Mike: </strong>Rebecca go.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>So I was thinking about it... because we were very young when diagnosed, but, you know, I think it's important to keep in mind that this doesn't this doesn't change what you've been through or anything that you've&nbsp; experienced. Having a Syngap diagnosis like we have,&nbsp;a lot of people mourn the fact that they have a diagnosis later in life and it should be a celebration in some way because there is a vast amount of information available to you now.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, it doesn't change the trajectory that you are on. Our kids are continually learning&nbsp;and science is evolving and it's evolving really quickly. And the best thing that you can do is&nbsp;once you've let all of that sink in, once you've tapped into the community,&nbsp; is to engage in whatever programs are out there so that as therapies do become available and, again, we're talking therapies. We're not talking cures. Therapies. You can be a part of it. And I'm done.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike's countdown. He's like \"shut up.\"&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mike: </strong>I would never say that to you, Rebecca. I would never. It's all gold.&nbsp; Thank you so much. Alright, Olga. You ready? One minute of wisdom. Go nuts.</p><p><strong>Olga: </strong>We were like Rebecca, diagnosed at a younger age, and I think, frankly, I was relieved we got a&nbsp; diagnosis because I really didn't know what was&nbsp; ahead, knowing that there's a life span and wasn't limited in that way. So I think just getting involved in the community, Syngap community, educating yourself as much as possible, educating the doctors that don't understand.&nbsp; You really have to manage I think all the different specialties. But pushing research is huge.&nbsp; That's why I got involved from the beginning. There's so much going on out there. I think that, you know, we all can do so much and we can all learn from each other. Don't despair. There's hope I think as they get older. I've seen it even between the ages of 6 and 13. You know, they'll always make progress. The one thing I didn't understand&nbsp; as a parent of a neurotypical child is they will make progress. But their skills are splintered and that is common knowledge to special education&nbsp; teachers and maybe some therapists. It was never never explained, really explained to me. It was kind of like after watching, you know, progress with ABA.&nbsp; I'm like, okay, well why are these gaps being filled in and these are not. And so keep that in mind for those of you with younger kids. Now I know we're talking more about teenagers. Don't lose hope. Really, you know, I'm still standing, Rebecca's still standing, we're all still standing.&nbsp; So, again, the key is pushing research, getting&nbsp; involved, and just, you know, we can all help each other out. Mike has done an incredible&nbsp; job of keeping us all together so it's really been great. It's been a great experience&nbsp; despite, you know, the ins and outs of everyday living with a child with Syngap. But there's so much joys to it too. I mean, my son has a great sense of humor. He doesn't have many words, but he has no problem with getting his message across. So not necessarily, you know, always the way we want it, but he knows. He knows his sister's about to go off to college too so&nbsp; we're going through the same thing. Right now, I mean, he's not as enamored with his sister&nbsp; anyway in general, just they were when they were&nbsp; younger, they were. But she's off doing her&nbsp; thing. We've done the same thing. Make sure she's...&nbsp; and she does not feel like that...&nbsp; So I think, I'm hoping, we've done a fairly good job, but she doesn't feel like it's impacted her too much. She feels like mom has a bigger impact. You know, mom needs more kids with Syngap so that mom doesn't pay attention to her. Yeah, that's the answer I've got. So I'm feeling good about that in one way and not in another. So we'll see which once she gets to college how that will all... but he'll probably be happy to go visit and see her and, you know... so that's&nbsp; been my experience. But I really, you know, being one of the first diagnosed and, you know, the first thing that came was like okay, I've heard about this but what is it and seeing that there was no research. Our neurologist wanted to do some research, when we finally found a neurologist that was working. So we didn't know we were having seizures. He was having seizures at six&nbsp; months old you, you know. Just little things, like... So but yeah. Research, research, research. Interact with each other. Just everybody can learn from each other. I think it's, you know, SRF has been a wonderful experience and will continue to be.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mike: </strong>Amen. Well, thank you, all three&nbsp; of you. We're a little bit over time, but I'm really grateful Jo that&nbsp; you're willing to do this and Rebecca. Here's my dog jumping in. We'll see you guys later. Thanks so much. This was great.<br></p>",

We now proudly introduce my wing woman, right hand woman, Elemy Yeme, BCBA. Here we go. </p><p>Elemy:&nbsp;Good morning everyone and thank you so much Monica. It really is my pleasure to be here today. I'd like to thank everyone for all the support and collaboration that goes into making this happen. Thank you to SRF, Mike and Ashley for tracing the road map for everybody. Thank you Sydney, Monica, Aaron, to all of the parents I have had the privilege to speak with. It really has been such an inspiring time to watch how far parents are willing to go. I am just forever grateful for the opportunity to be part of it all. Special thank you to my team: Sheena, particularly Kelsey who diligently worked with me to put this together, and most certainly thank you to my husband who allows the walls of our home to become research symposiums. Thank you all so much. </p><p>I am incredibly excited to be here today to talk about this unique and fascinating combination of Applied Behavior Analysis on a rare genetic disorder that is SYNGAP1. I know that when Applied Behavior Analysis is talked about people have an opinion, an idea, some people may not have either wherever you stand that's perfectly okay. I'm not here to bore you with technical jargon or tell you why ABA is or is not amazing. I will go over a very basic overview of ABA but what I want to talk about is why. Why should we want to know about ABA and its possibilities with Syngap and behavior. </p><p>So here's where I'm going to ask you not to shift but rather to be open to this perspective. To allow yourself to welcome the possibilities despite your current reality or circumstances. So why? Why do we think that this perspective of open mindedness and possibilities matter? And I'll tell you my 'why'. I think that all of this is particularly important to be discussed because I wholeheartedly believe in making quality of life a priority. In fact, the very nature of ABA requires it. ABA by definition is a science in which tactics derive from the principles of behavior are applied systematically to improve socially significant behavior and experimentation is used to identify the variables responsible for behavior change. So from this as an ABA provider my focus is improving socially significant behaviors and it is absolutely socially significant that every single one of your children and all members of your family experience quality of life. I support the families I work with to value quality of life as a focus of intervention and a treatment outcome, not only for the individual receiving it but for the parents, the caregivers, the family as a whole. So it is exactly in this connection between the definition of Applied Behavior Analysis and my personal value of quality of life which guides my practice that hope is found. ABA treatment is based on a science that focuses on social significance and that you can implement now. I'm going to say that again: ABA is for treatment for right now based on a science that focuses on socially significant change. Is treatment easy? Certainly not. Is it a one-size fits all? Is accessibility hard? It is very hard. We're all working on it. But bottom line: it does exist. It is possible and that should give us all hope that circumstances can be improved. It is just such a powerful place to start to know that. </p><p>And of course you're probably going to ask now how, where do I start? How do I change my circumstances? How do I improve my quality of life? And I have to be honest: I could talk to you about this for hours but we only have about 30 minutes. So I really try my best at categorizing the information in a way that is hopefully useful to you and that it gives you a place to start but know there is so much more to know and so much more to do. This four-step list is by no means exhaustive. </p><p>So the way to start is following these four steps: restructure your mindset about behavior and behavior management; approach Syngap's<br>multiple variables comprehensively; understand the function of the behavior; and learn to teach.</p><p>So step one: restructure your mindset about behavior and behavior management. This means to firmly believe that your child is capable, that your child can learn and that the challenging circumstances of caring for your child with a rare genetic disorder do not mean that those circumstances are unchangeable. It means accepting that Syngap is not the sole reason or cause of anything your child does and is especially not the sole reason or cause of behaviors. The term \"Syngap snap\" is somewhat representative of this idea that behaviors kind of come out of nowhere and they may seem unexplainable and i use it but it's truthfully inaccurate behaviors do not come out of nowhere and to think that we have no control or influence over the environment or the child's life is simply wrong we need to start shifting our focus from the behavior itself to the underlying causes of the behavior it is really easy for us neurotypical people to forget that our kiddos don't learn the same way and to do and to make assumptions about what we think they know but they're just that assumptions. It was recently brought to my attention that a family was experiencing severe maladaptive behaviors in the morning immediately upon the child waking up and while there are a lot of things to consider one of the things that I first brought up was how we taught the child to wake up this is a very clear example of how we make assumptions and we miss opportunities to target skill deficits we assume we go to sleep we wake up it stayed out and it's a new day no big deal but what tells us that our child knows that infants typically wake up crying going from a sleeping state to an awake state can be pretty overwhelming if you don't understand that transition or if you don't understand the world that is going on around us. </p><p>So now skill deficits are not impossible challenges. They're just opportunities to learn. They're very important. They're an essential step to address the underlying causes of the behavior. So then when we accept that Syngap is not the sole reason or the sole cause for behavior and understand that our child is fully capable of learning then we are able to recognize that we have some control over the environment and over our child's behavior. Once we develop this perspective then we must must must add expectations. Adding expectations literally means that you have expectations of your child know that your child can learn and with that just how you would have expectations of your neurotypical children you should have expectations for your child with Syngap. Set the expectations and make them high. Make them high but realistic. Make them achievable. Treat them like they are capable because they are. Unless they have proven to you that they are not that there is a clear barrier physical, biological, neurological, a clear barrier. There is no other reason for you to believe that they cannot accomplish something. You really will be so surprised by the things that they do.</p><p>And I'll share a story so that I can better explain what I mean. I was once told that my client couldn't walk more than a few minutes and that my 100 pound self needed to push his 150 pound self in a wheelchair for hours during community outings otherwise he would drop to the ground and not move until mom came. I went with it for some time but I did question the assumption why can the kid walk more than a few minutes. In fact, he can walk. So if he can walk why can't he walk? I was very confused now fast forward some time to the last interaction we had to that with that wheelchair that we pushed around for so long we i used it to go to walgreens to get a flu shot and i used it because i figured it would make it easier to get that new and hard task of getting a flu shot easier. So whatever. We got the flu shot and then afterwards we walked to Starbucks. Walked to starbucks. Next door now pushing the empty wheelchair we got our drink whatever walk out left the wheelchair at starbucks went back home whatever. Over the next several days we continued going on community outings. We went to stores and through outside any other places and we only ever realized the wheelchair was missing because the very kind people from starbucks reached out to the mom three days later. Three days later. I guess she had left um the paperwork from the flu shot there and they were able to get her information, reached out let her know that they still had the wheelchair and that they thought we would so urgently come back and get it but we never did. Because we didn't even notice. We don't ever need it. Never. So as you can see it turns out this kid can walk more than a few minutes. So shift your mindset. Your kids are so capable. They are capable of learning and are meeting realistic and high expectations. They are capable of this when you set those expectations, when you recognize and seek to understand the many variables that contribute to your child's behavior and when you take control over the environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Now this is not to say that Syngap is not important. That could be not farther from the truth. It is only to suggest that you don't use the diagnosis of Syngap as a way to justify the challenges you face with your child and let that prevent you from taking action. I am suggesting that you can improve yours and your family's circumstances by controlling your own actions and changing your own behavior. So to do that we first need to understand Syngap as of course as much as the literature currently allows and that leads us to step 2: Approach Syngap's multiple variables comprehensively.</p><p>Understanding Syngap, its symptoms, genotype, medical phenotype, behavioral phenotype, etiology and each individual child's history is a very hard task. It is hard because of all of the increased number of variables that you have to consider but just keep in mind they all matter. All of the variables really matter and while Syngap certainly predisposes your child to different challenges, many environmental variables influence how these predispositions present themselves. In the words of griffith scandal i can agree people and behaviors are complex and the end result, even in the case of behaviors that are associated with a genetic syndrome, is most often due to an interaction of genetic and environment variables. So understanding your child with Syngap absolutely presents its own unique set of challenges because it requires understanding many variables. But if we look at behavior as a product of both neurodevelopmental and physical limitations as well as the individual's learning history then we are able to identify interventions that successfully address skill deficits and that change the way in which the environment influences the behavior.<br>All of this to say: be hopeful because no matter where you're at, your child's life your life and your family's life can be improved through changes that you make to the variables in your child's environment. And I have here a non-exhaustive table of some of the variables to consider on one side I have Syngap symptoms pulled straight from the SRF website and on the other side I have other variables that I have found very important to be considered. This is just a visual representation and I show you this not to overwhelm you but to encourage you to understand your child comprehensively. All of these symptoms and variables have the potential to offer insight into how your child takes in, processes and responds to their world. They help you as a parent and me as a clinician to identify what to do, what strategies to use, and what providers can collaborate on.</p><p>Okay Syngap is a very unique rare disease that manifests very differently in every child. Every one of them experiences their own combination of Syngap symptoms and variables. So there is no one-size-fits-all treatment. There really isn't. It is both the responsibility and the privilege of your child's provider to comprehensively understand your child, to understand Syngap and to make their best effort to comprehend its many variables in order to guide better treatment outcomes. So in adopting this idea of a comprehensive approach collaboration among providers is critical. It's critical to understanding this many variables and achieving optimal health for your child. While I approach Syngap from a behavioral perspective, other experts, other clinicians provide information about variables to me that is very important for me to consider in order to provide effective behavioral services. As a behavior analyst I treat behavior based on its function. So within all of these variables like exactly that, the function of your child's behavior and that's gonna lead us to step three: Understand the function of the behavior. The function of the behavior is really nothing other than the reason. The cause of the behavior. Essentially why is the behavior happening. The cause or reason of the behavior gives us important information about the child's physical and mental state at any given time. Understanding the child's physical and mental state allows us to more successfully manage maladaptive behaviors. The function of the behavior also gives us information about the child's tolerability, motivation, and irritability and even allows us to identify some of the skill deficits that we're missing.</p><p>So I hear a lot of the parents say that behavior just comes out of nowhere but there's always a reason. Behavior does not occur randomly and it is not purposeless. There is a reason. There is a cause. We just have not identified it yet. And then these reasons can be very, very, very hard to identify. Sometimes they're internal variables that we can't see such as seizures or for pain for those that who are non-verbal, hormones for teenagers. Sometimes they're more straightforward like hitting to get parents attention or dropping to the ground so that we don't walk through the store. These variables, these reasons, they're endless but they do exist. </p><p>So now we have to ask the question: how. How do we identify these variables? How do I determine the function of my child's behavior? In ABA we take data. Massive amounts of data. We make correlations and we take on the very personal and very rewarding task of getting to know the child that we work with. We pay extremely close attention to the details and as you can see on this slide, we mean it. We really do. These are actual pictures of my team's environment when we attempt to understand these variables and this middle picture I wasn't lying about making size wall research symposiums at home. That's actually live on my home. We do all of this until data gives us useful information. I'll tell you an example. I had a client who had this behavior we were treating and it included dropping to the ground to avoid a task.&nbsp;With data a correlation was made that dropping behavior happened more often with constipation so knowing that and taking that into consideration I changed my treatment approach and we were significantly more successful in treating that dropping behavior. So when we take data it allows us to make connections between the variables that we are taking data on and the child's behavior. It allows us to look at the facts and to reach more objective conclusions. Objectivity is a critical component in order to mediate the environment we have to be objective so once you pinpoint the function of your child's behavior then you can successfully manage it by control controlling relevant variables, ruling out on important variables and targeting skill deficits through teaching. Doing all of this ultimately leads to better treatment outcomes, better responses from the child and enhanced quality of life. Before we can teach of course... here are all of the variables in data collection... before we can teach, we must first provide an optimal learning environment and build instructional control and that leads us to step four: learn to teach. </p><p>Optimal learning environment. An optimal learning environment is an environment responsive to the needs of each child. It emphasizes positive relationships,&nbsp;<br>supports each child's own agency, it encourages them and it leverages their individual strengths. A child having seizures cannot successfully learn. A child in distress, in pain or discomfort cannot successfully learn. So once we have considered all of the variables we talked about and we have attempted to control biological and physiological factors to the best of our ability with the collaboration from all of your providers and a collective effort then we can begin to ask things of your child. We can begin to teach different skills. In order to successfully teach these skills to your child you need to know exactly how your child learns. You need to find the specific strategies that work for your child and their learning modality. Based on this understanding, your understanding and knowledge of your child's needs differences and preferences, you can leverage their strengths and when we build on their strengths we're able to positively support and enhance their learning. </p><p>A fundamental step in teaching or successful teaching and trying to prevent maladaptive behaviors what we are trying to successfully teach the child is to build this instructional control. Instructional control simply means to build a trusting relationship between your child and yourself. Having instructional control means that your child listens to you because you have a positive working relationship and that simply they just trust you. They trust you so much they'll do it. So instructional control is the absolute most powerful thing you guys can establish and you can do that as a parent starting now. So if there's anything to take away from everything that I have said build instructional control. That's your number one step and well I can't walk you through the steps of building instructional control for the purpose of this presentation, the article \"seven steps to instructional control\" that is going to be included in the resources I believe you'll receive after the webinar is a very clear guide on how to build instructional control for parents. </p><p>So I so wish I could tell you that there was an easier alternative. That we knew more about your child's condition. That you didn't have to fight your neurologist to acknowledge your child's seizures. That you didn't have to fight your teachers and districts for appropriate placement and supports. That you have access to every treatment and every therapy that you need. But I'll be severely lying to you. It is unfortunate but you, the parents, the caregivers, have to do the work. You have to fight for your child. You have to raise awareness to educate yourself and others including providers and to build your own... your own tribe for your child. To advocate for your child's rights and to demand what you and your child deserve from every type of service that you receive.&nbsp;</p><p>Parent involvement is particularly important in ABA. It is well documented in the literature that parent involvement is an essential component of effective intervention. If the parent doesn't actively participate in teaching, ABA simply doesn't work the same. ABA is just not a... it's not a pill. It's not a pill that we can give you and fix your problems. It is not a cure. It is rather a way to facilitate improvements in your child's health and for you and your family to live a less stressful, less tiring and more fulfilling life for yourselves. It is exactly because parent involvement is essential that I believe ABA can be beneficial to you even if you don't have access to those services yet. ABA treatment is human to human interaction. It is day in and day out. It's patience. A lot of persistence and this it's home right now because of our circumstances with our own clinical team but it's an endless desire to success. So endless you literally always believe there is a way. There is there is a way. We just have to find it. Not available does not mean never available. Not existent just mean nothing is non-existent it just means we lack knowledge. It simply means it's unknown and we have to find that. We have to fill in those gaps and take on that task as our science continues to develop so that our current circumstances can be improved right now. We all have to collaborate but at the end of the day it is you the parents who hold the most power and ability in making a difference in your child's life. So I just gave you a few tools to get started but now you have to act on them. It's not just gonna happen. </p><p>So to conclude: essentially these four steps will provide you a framework for behavior management that is scientifically based, that focuses on socially significant behavior and that it will improve the quality of life for you, your child and your family. And the last thing I have to say is it's true: nothing great ever came easy. And ABA is not easy. Restructuring your mindset about behavior, comprehensively addressing Syngap's multiple variables, identifying the function of the behavior, and learning to teach is not easy. I am by no means suggesting it is but it is possible and the question I would encourage you guys to ask yourself is: which one's harder? So with that we can open up the room for Q&amp;A.</p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;Awesome Elemy. Thanks so much. We've got some really kind comments already coming in thanking you for what you've shared with us and for the hope that you've given most importantly. So I will go ahead and open us up for questions and answers. You guys will see that at the bottom. It's the question and answer button. If you would like to go ahead and type something in there to ask Elemy but our first question says: how do you manage when one of the parents is involved and the other parent is permissive and don't follow the guidance? And sorry I just want to say as well hey Monica especially because you have so much personal interaction with Elemy if there's something you'd also like to chime in and say about your personal experiences please feel free. </p><p>Monica:&nbsp;Absolutely. </p><p>Elemy:&nbsp;All right so how do you manage when I guess parents appear in disagreement a little bit? Then it it really depends. Like, if you're asking me as a BCBA that I would take that on myself on related to clinical recommendations and each parent just how we treat the child the parent is part of the treatment. So also I do implementation on the parent and depending on where the disagreement lies I will look for ways to get the parent who needs to get on-board on-board. So it's kind of like just the same way that you are doing specific strategies and specific implementations to get your child to do something, you have to treat your either partner or the parents the same way. Just telling just like you wouldn't just tell your child to stand up when you know they don't understand you to stand up you can't tell the parent you just have to do this because it's just not that simple. So you have to look for ways to reach that inside of the parent if that makes sense. </p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;Yeah like if we are maybe finding ourselves in this situation where we might have a spouse and our RBT, our therapist hasn't actually reached out to share these things with them would you suggest that you take it up with your RBT and say \"hey I'd like to see if we can get my partner or other caregiver more involved\". </p><p>Elemy:&nbsp;I would reach out to your BCBA. Okay the RBT is... all of the programs come from the BCBA so you could let your RBT know \"hey will you let BCBA know that I would like to target this\" but the RBTs are not equipped to make those decisions or program for anything like that. It would have to come from the BCBA so I would recommend you reach out to them. </p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;Sorry Monica did you want to say something as well? I think I cut you off a bit. </p><p>Monica:&nbsp;Yeah I was going to say not only the spouse or the partner but also if you have children or young adults in your home. Our daughters, young adults that they are, they have been \"trained\" per se. We have meetings with Elemy in the evenings for the family. We literally sit together at the table and talk about our challenges and her approaches and she coaches us through it because we all need to be consistent in saying, acting, doing the same same thing so that Jaxon just needs complete consistency and I think all of our kids do so.</p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;Great. All right so our next question says... by the way another person saying that the webinar was amazing but the next one says the place where I stay does not have ABA therapists so where and how can I start?&nbsp;</p><p>Elemy:&nbsp;Well to start with ABA there is a lot of ways that not a lot of ways a lot of things that need to be considered, diagnosis, all of that. But really if you as a parent which was- that was the message I really was more important most important for me to send, that you don't need to have access to the services to get started. You parents ultimately are the ones that are required whether you have treatment or not, to be able to implement all of this. So where to start? Here.&nbsp;<br>With the resources that we're going to send out. Start with that instructional control. Building this network. SRF is doing great. It's doing great efforts and keeping this network of BCBAs and collaboration. I've been contacted by a few parents. I'm happy to share resources. Eventually we're hoping in summer we have a parent training curriculum that everyone can access online. That's what we're doing, my company ElevABA. So hopefully we have a good like bundle: here's where you start, this is how you do it, if you don't have access to services yet. So that's how. Really just start reaching for the information. Start reaching out to us. Let's start really building this community. This is really our collective efforts and our collective goal.</p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;Awesome. I just want to speak to the fact that you said you have resources for us and we're still working on figuring out the best way to get those out to everybody who's attending but it is something that we'll get out to you. Elemy has made a compilation of things that she think will be most helpful to our families. Okay. So the next question says, all right it's a bit of a long one so stick with me. There's new dialogue emerging about ABA being painful for children with neurological impairments. If the behaviors are coming from a sensory route how do you handle that in ABA? Or when sometimes the behaviors may start as sensory how do you distinguish between the sensory response and behavior management?</p><p>Elemy:&nbsp;Data. How do you distinguish them? Data. It all comes down to that. Again, none of these things like, it is the biggest thing about I can personally say from my experience with Syngap: it's the variables. The variables are endless and they are hard to identify and they're hard to narrow it down but if you take it one at a time and you narrow it down, you eventually, eventually get there. Sensory: how I manage that... it really just depends on, it's not a simple answer like it depends on what type, it depends on what the behavior looks like, what are things that we can attempt but some of the things that I would try to start mediating if I think there is a sensory issue it's just trying different things. So for example, if my kid is climbing up the rail of the stairs and he's consistently climbing on furniture and then he engages in a maladaptive behavior, then I would try something like giving some proprioceptive input like just looking at all of these different variables. As far as ABA being painful and all of that, it's such a long conversation and I have so much I could tell you about it. I would invite you to to just be open. ABA is a science and it's effective. Just like anything else there is good ABA and there's bad ABA. So learn to distinguish that. Learn to distinguish that because it's so very important. Us as clinicians we are taught and it's interesting that parents, most of the parents I have ever encountered in my career, don't know this: we are supposed to make the calls about a clinical fit. So sometimes an RBT will come into your house and you're like \"I don't know if it's working...\" and like, all of that. There are certain cases that is simply not a clinical fit. Like your child, just like you don't like some people, your child doesn't like some people either. It's normal human nature and parents don't know this. So it's very important that you, particularly Syngap parents, know that you have a huge complexity and that you need to identify what is best for your child and what is good and what is not. And with Syngap I feel like you really need the best of the best. Like you... sometimes we're like, how do we even manage or learn or do all of that? So just know that. I told you I'm not gonna sell you on ABA. I'm an ABA provider. I believe in my science. I know it's effective when done well.</p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;Great. So I actually have a follow-up question from that question and based on what you've just said but my child's been through several RBTs and two different ABAs within less than a year and when we got our second company that we were working with I didn't realize that we could have been doing so much better all along and so I'm wondering if you can maybe give some of us who are maybe towards the beginning of our journey or maybe we've been on it for a while with ABA and we're wondering, you know, is this as good as it gets? Do I have the best? What are some, like, red flags that we're not maybe working with the right people? Or that we should, you know, consider making a change to what we're, maybe who we're cooperating with for our&nbsp;kiddos?&nbsp;</p><p>Elemy:&nbsp;And I actually would love to like make a list or something like that because that is something that is the the very first question that I literally 100% of the time of the parents that I have talked to from Syngap community is that question. Like, where do... how do we start understanding? So like, you guys don't know how... you don't know what you don't know. So I would love to actually make it a resource. But a few of the indicators that I can think about right now... first I would start with really understanding the treatment. So when you get services let's say you have your diagnosis whatever it is we come in and do an assessment. Right? When we do an assessment ABA we are required to establish our clinical recommendation. And that's what we're telling to your insurance \"hey, for what I am seeing and what I'm assessing, this is the level of treatment that I need for this child to progress.\" That level of treatment is on that report of that assessment. Step number one: get a copy of that of that report. Get that report. You need to know what your child is working on and what the clinical recommendation is. That clinical recommendation tells the hours that are supposed to be fulfilled by your direct intervention intervention, your RBT, and on the clinical hours that is recommended for the BCBA to be there to do treatment protocol modifications and to do parent training. Make sure that your providers are fulfilling those hours. That's our clinical recommendation. When I give a clinical recommendation I stand by it because this is how we fight your insurance to fulfill the services. To fight that medical necessity and this is huge in our field right now where we clinicians are making these recommendations that we're not fulfilling. I'm telling you I need this amount of hours but I'm not getting all of those hours. So that's step number one. Make sure that you get those hours. Involvement: a lot of what happens right now is the BCBAs really are the most qualified to help the case, to develop programs,&nbsp;to guide the RBTs. There's a lot of young RBTs in the field. Like, you could literally get a brand new RBT straight from high school to come. Like I would never, ever in a million years would I allow that to come in with Jaxon. It's just it wouldn't happen. You know, so but not knowing the circumstances and whatever like all these RBTs just come in and they're a little clueless and then you don't realize. You get what you get and you're like \"oh, this is ABA treatment\" but it's not. So an indicator would be BCBA presence. Is your BCBA involved? Do you feel like you're more connected to your RBT than you are to your BCBA? And yes, a little bit because your RBT is there every day and your BCBA is not but that is I think on us BCBAs to make sure that I'm your go-to person. That you know that I am here that I got it. That I'm leading us to this place and I'm the head of the team. Whether your RBT is there all the time or not. Like, that's the trusting relationship that you want to develop with your BCBA. That you can literally lean on them. That would be a like an indicator. Progress. I mean, in general if you really think you're seeing... This is a huge one. Trust yourself. Trust yourself. I tell Monica this all the time. The expert on your child is you. No one else. You. No neurologist can tell you your child is not having seizures. You see it. You you know, obviously within reason, like you're not of course we have the parents who just want to do what they want to do, whatever. Assuming that you are keeping this perspective of openness and that I just always... I don't sugarcoat it. I'm gonna tell you as a parent like \"hey, parent this is what it is. This is what you need to do.\" You can choose it, leave it, whatever but assuming that you have that open perspective, know that you are right. You're right. If you don't have a good feeling, if you feel like your child is not progressing, if you feel like you're not getting like fruitful information, you feel motivated you're like, oh this worked with my child like what Elemy told me dang, II got it! If you don't feel like that like, it's ups and downs but consistently with your treatment, you're right. Seek for something else. Does that make sense? That kind of answer? I think you're frozen. Sydney? Oh there you are okay great.</p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;Sorry yeah I know sorry connection may be just a little bad over here. But I think what you said was really empowering and it's something that you know, we learn I think quite quickly in the Syngap community is that we indeed are the expert on our own children because you come across so many different healthcare providers and sometimes even therapists who don't tend to see everything that you're seeing or maybe don't agree with you about the severity of things or something like that. And so I do think that that's kind of the golden rule as you've said about assessing how your treatment with ABA is going is, you know, if you feel confident that this is actually doing something positive for your kids and that we're addressing the correct things. You did also speak to the point of making sure that the clinical recommendation for hours for a child is actually met and somebody has asked how many hours of ABA a week does a child (and I'm going to say a Syngap child) need on average? I'm sure there's not a cookie cutter response but maybe if you can speak to that a little bit? </p><p>Elemy:&nbsp;Yeah I can't. I could not answer that question at all. It really depends on the child and I know that every Syngap kiddo has their own complexities and everything but I wouldn't, I really wouldn't even be comfortable giving you a straight answer. However I can tell you my guidelines and maybe that's something I can pull out for us as well. This is directly from the BACB board which is where we get our licenses from. There is two type of treatments which is the focused and the comprehensive. So when you go and do treatment you're working on all of these different domains right. Working on communication, socialization, adaptive skills,&nbsp;parent training, behavior. So a focus treatment is 10 to 20 hours a week, something like that for direct intervention and a focused treatment only focuses on one to two domains. So we would only work on behavior or/and communication or only work on behavior because of course ABA is practiced. Like, you have to be repetitive so that it just gets in the repertoire. A comprehensive treatment is one that you target all of the domains that have deficits. A comprehensive treatment is often 30 to 40 hours, 25 to 40 hours a week of direct intervention and that typically 40 hours would be the the very max. I don't foresee a kiddo needing like that's just a full-time job. Like, why would you work more than your full-time job? So knowing Syngap as a whole and as a complexity I would say I don't know that there is a Syngap kid that could do a focus program. So we would do a comprehensive. Like, anywhere probably about 20-25 hours is a fair bet but really just depends on the child but looking at those that's kind of how you can best base it on. If your child has communication issues, socialization, behavior, then you can assume we're going on the higher end than not. </p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;Okay, great. Monica do you maybe want to...? We'll throw this one to you first actually because we're being asked are there any good tips for helping to manage different expectations between the child with Syngap and a neurotypical sibling? And all of your children are, you know, this is a journey they've been on for a while. So I'd really love to hear your answer to that and then Elemy you're definitely welcome to chime in as well. </p><p>Monica:&nbsp;I just have to say that Aaron and I have raised two amazing young adult children. 19 and 22. Our parenting skills had to completely change when Jaxon came along and we didn't realize that. We thought, you know, we didn't realize what journey Jaxon was on until later as he wasn't quite meeting his milestones. Anyways, we had to completely change our approach to teaching and it wasn't until we really got heavily involved with ABA therapy that we realized we cannot parent, teach, Jaxon as we did our our older daughters. So I have relied heavily on ABA practices and we live, eat, and breathe that language and I firmly believe in it. And just speaking a little bit back to the amount of hours, there comes a point when your child, Jaxon is 15, there comes a point when your child can only take on so many OT, speech, PT hours, feeding therapy hours, whatever it may be. At one point I threw my hands up and said it's got to be ABA therapy. We've got to take a break. Our child is human. He's fatigued. They can only take on so much. As the caregiver or parent as well. So and it may come down to a point where you know, if you have an amazing ABA team like we do, you will incorporate those deficits that an OT or an SLP, those social skills that your child might need. If they have, if you have an amazing group like we do, they will cover it. They will teach you. They will teach your child. So just speaking on both points on that. </p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;Definitely. Before you had put so much time and effort towards ABA, I wonder like, what were the techniques or I guess the expectations for your older kids as far as what was gonna be normal for them versus what was gonna be normal for Jaxon and family life? Especially when they were a little bit younger and may not have had all the understanding that they do now as adults?</p><p>Monica:&nbsp;I have to say that both Aaron and I tried to do a decent job. We made an effort to really carry the weight of Jaxon's challenges on our shoulders and not our daughters' shoulders. And I don't know if that's good or bad but that was our approach. Sure, they're exposed to everything 24/7 when they're in the home but we made sure to keep them involved with sports, church, things like that, their extracurricular activity so that they would not feel that resentment towards their younger brother because he is the center of our focus in our home. And I really have to say it wasn't until they got older even closer to when we hit this pandemic that they truly embraced all that went into caring for Jaxon. Just because we had really desensitized them to it and I don't know if that's good or bad but that was our approach. And you know they love him dearly. They're his number one advocate, speaker of the voice he does not have. But that was our approach. Again, they have to, they had to learn the language of ABA therapy. You know, that's just our way of living and they know that they cannot deviate from that or you know, our... everything that we work so hard to do will be undone. So... so yeah. </p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;Thanks. Elemy, did you want to add anything to that? </p><p>Elemy:&nbsp;Yeah I actually would like to. This is me speaking as a behavior analyst just so that I can better answer the question because I feel like I even know from Monica's perspective what could be set... what expectations. Like, expectations for the child. Like, how you're treating one your neurotypical child different than your Syngap child or the expectations that your neurotypical child is having for their life. Like, what exactly are we wanting to know about? </p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;Yeah so the the question that we're coming back to is managing different expectations between the child with Syngap and a neurotypical sibling.</p><p>Elemy:&nbsp;So you having your expectations of your child is that...?&nbsp;</p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;Sorry my printer's going crazy in the background. But I think that they mean, and you're welcome to correct me if I'm wrong here question asker, but I think that they mean your neurotypical child seeing that the expectations for them versus their sibling with Syngap is different. Yeah. </p><p>Elemy:&nbsp;Yeah, this is this is why I kind of like giggled earlier because... and it depends on where that question is coming from. Like, what's your current circumstance? But I can speak for our experience. I'll tell you an example. We were working on Jaxon clearing his plate when he ate. Right? He's eating, whatever, it's only appropriate that you pick up your plate and put it in the sink. And Monica'd be the first one like \"hey, you forgot your plate\" and then Jaxon's sisters would come back from the gym, make their breakfast and leave their plates. And I'd be like \"Monica, what kind of nonsense is this? That you require this from your Syngap kiddo but you don't require this from your other children?\" I'm like \"Why? Why are you not making like your expectations... like, how does it make sense? Just because it's appropriate that you pick up your plate? Well, teenagers don't pick up their plates. So why are you making him pick up his plate?\" You know? So as far as the child and I think that in our experience Jaxon is the youngest, so really managing those expectations is like, you have to find the the balance. Like, your neurotypical child is going to inevitably at some point come about \"well, why is he to doing...?\" Especially young ones. Particularly young ones are harder and I actually have worked with two Syngap families and they're younger so those expectations were harder but what II would say for parents is like, really mediating. Just remember that you are in control. Don't ever forget that the world is not happening to you. You're happening to their world. So you are in charge and be hyper aware of those expectations. They need to be realistic but keep them consistent. Like, within kind of like what I talked about earlier. Know what's achievable for your child but also don't handicap them. Like, you don't have to change your expectations just because they have Syngap. Make them realistic but make them high. If everyone in your household picks up their plate then and he can pick up his plate, then everybody needs to pick up their plate. And that way it's kind of a way to... a more realistic way to manage those expectations for when you're explaining this to your child because when you have an actual reason \"hey, why do you... I don't know, push him in the wheelchair as opposed to be having to walk?\" Well, actually he can't walk. Whatever it is. He has a blister. You have a reason as opposed that to you defaulting to \"well, he has Syngap, I have to help him.\" You know? Like, that's the differentiation I would make. Like, have an explanation. A logical explanation (and reasonable) why you're not holding the same expectations and then don't do it for anything else. Hold the same expectations for your children.</p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;Awesome. All right. So I think we'll close with this last question and it's from me about helping us to understand how we can make sure that our RBTs and BCBAs are able to identify like the physical disease components which can be factors in behavior. So for instance: like, you know when we as parents know about like, our child's constipation or their seizures, we know all of their meds, their likes and their dislikes, things that, things that are caused by Syngap, how do we communicate these kind of health-related things that might be factors to our to our care team? And how much should we expect that they know about these elements of Syngap when they first come into our homes?</p><p>Elemy:&nbsp;Make them read. Like, that's...&nbsp;really... it's just, it's really tough to say that you know, there is a specific strategy. Like, I feel if I go to a parent and they tell me I'll be the first one to be like, \"let me look it up\" but that's half of the challenge with... I don't think ABA like any practitioner right like, I've even experienced it in trying to collaborate for Jaxon's treatment, that everyone, every practitioner believes in what they believe in and they're like \"you're wrong and my science is right\" and all of that. So it's kind of like the same. They're like well, I'm a BCBA and I do behavior and whatever. So I would... this kind of like goes into the... what I talked about... require your providers to know Syngap. Because it's hard as it is that we don't know but we don't know that it's available. It is much harder when you don't understand that. Like, if you... I cannot imagine not understanding the implications, how Syngap works, everything like that. So what I what I would recommend is just approach it in a very kind like, humble in a way, place. Just be like \"listen, I really need your help and I want this to be successful. It would be so extremely important for me for you to read this\", whatever like for you to really understand like what my child needs. And what's going to help you parents the most when you have our services is collaboration. So show us that you don't want me to just come fix you, right? Because I can't. I need you to participate. So if you show me that okay, I really want to change. Like, I'm not telling you BCBA that you're wrong just to tell you that you're wrong. I'm really just telling you: hear me out.&nbsp;Like, please hear me out. Read this and then if for whatever reason you're wrong. Like, in the sense that okay, well it wasn't the constipation. It was clearly him avoiding the task. Okay, then we can come to a common conclusion and then that's where the collaboration happens. But really just tell them \"I really need your help. It would mean really a lot to me if you understand this. We've gotten feedback from providers who have been successful\" and then I would put just I think our articles are hard to read as they are, but maybe just a few things that are important for a provider to start even considering. Like, what are the main things that we should know to even start looking at it. And require it. Next time your BCBA comes around be like \"what did you think about that paper? Tell me your thoughts.\" Because you know, we're practitioners and we're taught to manage parents too. So I could be like \"of course, yeah, sure\" and then just be like \"whatever\". Like, really require it. That's what I mean by like, it has to be you. It has to be you. The one who establishes those standards for everybody. It has to be you. The one who is like, \"come on, people\". You know, like really hold us accountable. Really do. And you have the right. Don't feel bad. Don't feel bad. As long of course you're nice, kind, and whatever. That's our job. It's our job. Look at it like that.</p><p>Monica:&nbsp;Sydney if I could also share? Sydney on this I think it's super important that we're very honest with our team, as far as everything from their medications to their sleep to their BMs. Everything. The minute they walk in our door we go through a checklist. We talk about just because we know of different... everything... variables... just there's so many variables in Jaxon's treatment and everything from sleep to what he's eating, how many drinks he's had. It is so important for them to take that into consideration. If he's been awake at three o'clock in the morning they know not to go hard on him that day or to be more patient and whatnot. And I know our lives can be very shocking, whatever you wanna call it. We can have some rough roads and oftentimes people don't want to share what's happening but those are the people that you want to share with the most because they're there to help you and they can only give you suggestions, techniques, whatever on what you provide them with and how your family is doing and standing. So I really think that honesty is best. Let them know the ins and outs and yeah, that's my one suggestion as far as a comprehensive approach would you have it. </p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;Great. Yeah and I think too like, Elemy, the sense that I really get from you is that more information is better and I think sometimes us as Syngap parents because everything is so incredibly complex all of the time we tend to like weed out details and give what we think is most important but I think with really great ABA providers they probably actually want to hear everything that you could possibly tell them. </p><p>Elemy:&nbsp;Oh my gosh Sydney. For the longest time Monica would say oh Jaxon sleeps great. Jaxon sleeps great. Why would I know he didn't, right? And then one day recently she's like \"well, yeah he was awake.\" I'm like \"what do you mean? You've always saw me he sleeps great.\" Yeah, well in comparison to everybody else he wakes up two, three times a night. That's not a big deal. I'm like: \"oh my gosh! I need to know this!\" I mean that's not great sleep. It's interrupted sleep. Three times a night! It's so very important you tell us everything. We need to know because the slightest detail matters. It matters. </p><p>Sydney:&nbsp;Yeah. Great. Well, with that Elemy I just want to say thank you so much for all of the really good information that you've given us and Monica I really appreciated that you were here too because I think the team between a parent and a provider, you guys are obviously a very successful and well bonded team and that's so great and so encouraging for the rest of us to see what is actually possible. We just feel like you've given us so much hope for our children and just information about how to find really great providers like yourself that are out there. So with that we'll go ahead and end the webinar. Thanks again. </p><p>Elemy:&nbsp;Thank you. </p><p>Monica:&nbsp;Thanks.</p>",

Within this post, he obtained a Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Training Fellowship to examine the relationship between the autism and schizophrenia spectrums.</p><p>Following this, he was appointed as a Senior Clinical Research Fellow in the Division of Psychiatry and Co-director of the Patrick Wild Centre.</p><p>He undertakes clinical work as an honorary consultant psychiatrist for NHS Lothian Learning Disability Services, including sessions for the Regional Autism Spectrum Disorders Consultancy Service.</p><p>He is also a founding board member of Tailor Ed Foundation, a lottery funded charity which provides behavioural interventions to children with autism.</p><p>After this brief introduction, I want to let you know a recorded version of this webinar will be available on the SRF website.</p><p>By the end of this presentation, you will have an opportunity to get your questions answered. We’d love to hear from you – please write your question in the chat.</p><p>For those of you just joining us, welcome to our talk today by Dr. Andrew Stanfield entitled ¨ Cognition, behaviour and clinical trials in SYNGAP1¨. It is now my pleasure to turn things over to Dr. Stanfield.</p><ul><li>Older animal models to look at whether treatments are effective.</li><li>Trials across the age range.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Here are our final comments:</h2><p>Thank you very much Dr Stanfield and all your team for the work you do . You clearly summarised the key challenges in developing clinical trials, particularly the challenges in approximating efficacy in animal models and the challenges in finding biomarkers in neurodevelopmental conditions. You also spoke about barriers in recruitment, the challenges families face in being able to participate in studies and trials and how we may innovate in that area.</p><ul><li>Your thoughts on data we can prepare/capture/fund to position SYNGAP1 to be best prepared for clinical trials for targeted therapeutics. Given that we as a disease are perhaps looking at trials that target the underlying cause of the disease but also may be eligible to participate in drug trials that target the common mechanisms of ID/ASD.</li><li>In the latter part of 2020 SRF launched our digital natural history study, a retrospective longitudinal study based on electronic health care records with partners Ciitizen. Currently close to 100 US based participants enrolled.&nbsp;</li><li>We note Stoke Therapeutics recently described primary endpoints in their Dravet mRNA antisense trial (STK-001) are toxicity and pharmacokinetics, secondary endpoint is seizure reduction. Adaptive &amp; behaviours on further open label studies (Vineland). Your thoughts perhaps on how this trial and others (Angelman GTX-102) might influence a SYNGAP1 (or even FXS) “smart” drug trial endpoints.</li><li>We are conscious of our very small patient population, likely to be ~1000 by year end 2021 and how difficult it will be to recruit for trials. Your thoughts on the future challenges of distributed trial participation?</li></ul><p>You spoke about the importance of participant recruitment:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>One of the things we suffer from as a disease/disorder is <strong>underdiagnosis</strong>. I’d ask you to speak about the barriers to increasing genomic diagnosis of children and adults with learning disabilities and how we as a patient group might work to overcome this.&nbsp;</li><li>We know in the SYNGAP1 community it’s really rather rare to get a diagnosis as an adult (we have a short film coming in the next few months about the life of a 65 year old lady recently diagnosed with SYNGAP1 in New Jersey).&nbsp;</li><li>Sequencing does not seem to be as readily available on the NHS? We note from social media that UK families tell us microarray is performed but paediatrics are perhaps not always referring for further sequencing.&nbsp;</li><li>We also suffer from a lack of racial and ethnic diversity in diagnosis and this must also be true for ID genomic diagnosis in general.<br></li></ul>",

George and Ahern have teamed up to create a treatment that will be useful for many different diseases. &nbsp;They leverage basic biology to create a tool that will “read through” a premature stop within a protein. &nbsp;Who does this help? &nbsp;In fact, many of the Syngap1 pathogenic variants (and pathogenic variants for many diseases) are caused by single-base changes in the DNA that result in premature termination of the protein. &nbsp;The changes that will be targeted by their treatment are called nonsense variants because they do not code for an amino acid at that point, but encode a “stop” &nbsp;instead so that the protein-making machinery stops before synthesizing the complete protein.</p><p>Dr. George gives a great overview of the basic biology behind the tRNA read-through concept. &nbsp;Dr. Ahern discusses how a treatment might get delivered with an Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV), and importantly shows that the treatment does not have off-target effects. &nbsp;Dr. Ahern describes the next steps in developing a clinical treatment, including making mouse models with protein-truncating variants to test.</p><p>The initial results showing no off-target effects are stunning, are applicable to many genes and many patients.</p>",

Dr. Sanders has been invaluable in developing frameworks for identifying autism risk genes as well as the mechanisms by which mutations in these genes cause disruption to developmental pathways.</p><p>Today’s talk is “How &amp; why to use human cellular models to study Syngap1” by Dr. Marcelo Pablo Coba. <a href=\"https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/marcelo-pablo-coba/\">Dr.</a> Coba, is an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at the<a href=\"https://www.keckmedicine.org/\"> University of Southern California’s (USC) Keck School of Medicine</a>. Dr. Coba’s impressive educational background includes a Doctor of Pharmacy and postdoctoral work in Neuroscience. His education sets him apart and aligns well with SynGAP patients’ needs.</p><p>Dr. Coba has a long-standing interest in the role of proteins like SYNGAP1 that are important in the synaptic function, synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. He wants to help us understand the molecular and cellular changes that occur in our Syngapians. Professor Coba proposed a plan to address this essential and complicated question. The proposed work includes ground-breaking new ways to describe the effects of known pathogenic SynGAP1 variants in neuronal cells, and is critical to finding molecular targets for potential medications.</p><p>Dr. Coba has a close working relationship with SRF, and has been generous sharing his ideas and listening to parents. For several years Dr. Coba has been working on SynGAP1 Encephalopathy. Now he is asking the Syngap Research Fund to support his work. He is optimistic this will eventually lead to better outcomes in translational research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We as a group feel privileged and lucky to have Dr. Coba working with us and we are thrilled to support his work.</p><p>After this brief introduction, I want to let you know a recorded version of this webinar will be available on the SRF website.</p><p>By the end of this presentation, you will have an opportunity to get your questions answered.

The goals of the series are:</p><ul><li>getting you closer to the science&nbsp;</li><li>making you aware of the research that is been done and the opportunities to participate</li><li>and empowering your communications with clinicians&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We also want to remind you of our next webinar in the series with Dr. Connie Smith-Hicks on “Biomarker Development a path towards clinical trial readiness in SYNGAP1” scheduled later this week, August 5 at 2 pm ET.</p><p>The talk today is “What is epigenetics and how can it accelerate therapies for SYNGAP?”</p><p>Today’s speaker is Dr. Elizabeth Heller, who is an Assistant Professor of Pharmacology at UPENN (University of Pennsylvania) and also a SYNGAP caregiver. Her story is unique as her inspiration to research SYNGAP is very personal. Her niece Ruby Heller, now 14, was diagnosed with SYNGAP in 2016. At that time her interest as a neuroscientist regained a focus on SYNGAP. She has first-hand knowledge of SYNGAP as a disease. She’s close to her niece and understands how SynGAP turns a family's life upside down.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Heller received her PhD in molecular biology from The Rockefeller University. She then studied the epigenetics of drug addiction and depression at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. In 2016 she returned to UPENN as an Assistant Professor.&nbsp;</p><p>The Heller Lab studies the mechanisms by which epigenome remodeling regulates neuronal gene function and behavior. Her lab is uniquely suited to carry out epigenetic research in SYNGAP. It consists of experts across neuroscience and genetics, including chromatin biochemistry, behavioral neuroscience, next-generation sequencing, machine learning, and CRISPR/Cas9-directed epigenetic editing. Her research is supported by membership in the Penn Epigenetics Institute and the Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics.</p><p>I want to quote Dr. Heller’s owns words “My niece has given me extraordinary gifts in terms of my personal growth as a caregiver and communicator, and I am ever grateful to be one of her Special People. It is a privilege to enter the Syngap1 research field as a molecular and behavioral neuroscientist”.</p><p>We as a group felt privileged and lucky that Dr. Heller is going to dedicate her lab to find what is outside of the gene --of how everything else in the genome affects the regulation of a gene. This is an area of research that hasn’t been touched in SYNGAP that may hold another gigantic clue or clues and can be a big part of the puzzle.</p><p>After this brief introduction, I want to let you know a recorded version of this webinar will be available on the SRF website. </p><p>By the end of this presentation, you will have an opportunity to get your questions answered. We’d love to hear from you – please write your question in the chat.</p><p>For those of you just joining us, welcome and our talk today “What is epigenetics and how can it accelerate therapies for SYNGAP?” by Dr. Elizabeth Heller neuroscientist and SYNGAP caregiver.<br></p>",

Understanding phase separation will help elucidate facets of protein interactions and movements within the PSD. &nbsp;</p><p>Comparing the amino acid sequences of 132 different mammalian versions of Syngap1 shows an unusually high level of sequence conservation. &nbsp;One interpretation is that Syngap1 protein interacts with other proteins and itself along the entire length of the protein.</p><p>Dr. Kennedy shared her idea that Syngap1 acts as a dial to fine-tune the amount of AMPA-R at the membrane, by changing the levels of exocytosis and endocytosis. &nbsp;She pointed out that this idea is different from an interpretation favored by Dr. Huganir’s lab. &nbsp;When we hear that two scientists have differing interpretations we are excited, as it can lead to new experiments and important insights. &nbsp;We are lucky that Syngap1 biology is being studied in multiple labs with different specialties, and we look forward to more insights from Dr. Kennedy and her lab.</p>",

His PhD focused on Genetics and Development. He then did his residency in pediatrics and neurology at Baylor College Of Medicine and post-doctoral fellowship in neurogenetics at University of California San Francisco. Dr. Holder is currently a neurologist at the Blue Bird Neurology Clinic and main investigator at the Holder’s lab at the Jan and Dan Duncan Pediatric Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children's Hospital.</p><p>The Holder’s lab's primary research is the genetic and neurobiological basis of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Their goal is to discover individualized therapies for neurodevelopmental disorders. SynGAP is one of the main areas of study. Using cell-based screens to mouse models of disease to neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of SYNGAP1 patients, they try to find genetic modifiers of the protein stability, to identify therapeutic entry points for SYNGAP1. His lab also has a focus on finding biomarkers and deep phenotyping investigating particular areas like sensory, sleep, and walking (waking?) patterns of SYNGAP1. Their ultimate goal is to translate the findings from the lab back to the clinic to improve the quality of life of children with SYNGAP1.<br> <br>Dr. Holder has participated in several paramount publications in SynGAP and is considered one of the clinicians and researchers with deep knowledge of the disease. He is also extremely compassionate, enthusiastic, and kind when seeing his SYNGAP1 patients in his neurology clinic. We are truly grateful for the work he has done and his interest in SYNGAP1.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Transcript:</h2><p>Thank you Mike and Marta for inviting me to give this talk today.</p><p>So a couple of disclosures: I will talk about some off-label uses of medications kind of a standard disclosure but I think the one that might be of more interest to the families that are on this call is that I'm actually a father of a child with a neurogenetic disorder which some of you may know and so that you know, in addition to my training, clinical training and basic science training, really informs me in terms of what it means to live day to day with a with a child with a neurogenetic disorder. </p><p>So for a number of years since I've been an independent investigator I've basically worked in these two buildings. The building on the left is the outpatient clinic at Texas Children's Hospital which is where the Blue Bird neurology clinic is and then the building on the right is the Jan and Dan Duncan neurological research institute and my initial goal was to take information to take knowledge, take samples, from patients that I see in the building on the left and take it to the right and try to understand at a deeper level the causes, the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders and then ultimately to, as Mike said, go back from the basic science realm, the translational science realm, back to the clinic with that knowledge and with the tools that we've developed to hopefully have individualized treatments for neurodevelopmental disorders. </p><p>So what I'm going to talk to you about today is some of our efforts specifically related to Syngap in that regard. So SYNGAP1 was first identified as a cause of neurodevelopmental disorders still just 11 years ago and it's really this landmark paper that probably most people on this call know about from 2009 where the first three children, three little girls with loss of function mutations were identified in SYNGAP1 with intellectual disability. Since that initial publication there have been a number of additional works that have identified mutations in other cohorts of children with neurodevelopmental disorders including epilepsy, intellectual disability again, as well as autism. Very recent work just from this year the largest study, exome study, exome sequencing study, to identify rare variants that cause autism identified Syngap as one of the most prevalent causes of loss of function mutations in autism. So what do we know about the SynGAP protein? So the SynGAP protein is a Ras/Rap GAP and that is it acts on small G proteins to regulate their activity. It normally acts to inhibit their activity and in particular for Ras inhibition of Ras results in downstream inhibition of signaling pathway that limits the insertion of a particular type of receptor called the AMPA receptor which is important for excitatory neurotransmission. When you have a mutation in Syngap and therefore a reduction in the SynGAP protein by 50%, you have an increase probably in the number of small G protein activity of small G proteins but this includes Ras which leads to increased activity of ERK and eventually increased insertion of AMPA receptors in the synapse. And overall this is thought to result in increased excitation of neurons and this leads to some of the phenotypes that we see in kids including epilepsy it's probably and probably also intellectual disability. </p><p>So with the knowledge that loss of function mutations in Syngap cause a neurodevelopmental disorder and 20 years of knowledge of the function of the SynGAP protein where do we go for patients with SYNGAP1 mutations? So what do we have? We have animal models including mice and rats and actually also zebrafish that model SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency and based on that in 20 years of research into the basic neurobiology of SynGAP we know a lot about its function. Again we also have a growing list of human mutations, either loss of function mutations or other types of mutations called missense mutations which alter potentially either the stability of the SynGAP protein or the function of the protein. </p><p>We're learning more and more about the phenotypes that can potentially be associated with these mutations. And then very recently our group and I'll go through some of this data towards the end of my talk in collaboration with Gavin Rumbaugh characterize human neurons completely deficient for the SynGAP protein so what do we need although we know a lot about the phenotypes associated with SYNGAP1 mutations we do not currently have a large amount of prospective clinical data available that would be useful for future clinical trials mutations in SYNGAP1 are rare and it's likely that future clinical trials will utilize we'll need to utilize existing prospective data as as a control for determining whether a particular treatment is efficacious we need a better understanding of the heterogeneity of the clinical manifestations associated with SYNGAP1 mutations and this is in part through identifying more and more mutations in the SYNGAP1 gene but also in characterizing a larger group of individuals again in a prospective way with SYNGAP1 mutations we also need patient neuron data this data will be extremely useful for validating whether treatments that are developed in the lab are potentially efficacious in human neurons we need therapeutic entry points and we need preclinical studies of those therapies developed in the lab so what I'll talk about today are some of the some of the work that we've done both in the clinic as well as in the lab looking at the heterogeneity of clinical phenotypes associated with SYNGAP1 mutations some of the work that many of you on this call are listening to the recording have been involved with in terms of prospective clinical studies of phenotypes associated with SYNGAP1 mutations.</p><p>I'll talk some about the our efforts in the lab to develop patient-derived neurons for investigating pathophysiology as well as for therapeutic modeling and then at the end I'm going to talk about some potential approaches for personalized therapies for patients with SYNGAP1 mutations including things like gene therapy so this is a an update of a figure we published a couple of years ago now demonstrating the landscape of mutations found in SYNGAP1 associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and I will say that the number of publications the number of patients identified with mutations in Syngap is growing so fast that it's hard to keep up with this figure but one thing that you'll notice is that the majority of patients with mutations in SYNGAP1 those mutations tend to land towards the middle of the gene basically from exons four through 18 or so of the gene and the reason for this is probably because there's extensive what's called alternative splicing that occurs at the far ends of the gene and what that means is that although SYNGAP1 is a single gene that single gene can produce a number of different types of protein of proteins and mutations that occur more at the five prime at the very far left or the very far right of the SYNGAP1 gene potentially only affect a small subset of the proteins that are made from this from this gene and therefore may not have as as significant deleterious effects as those mutations that land right in the middle of the gene.</p><p>So again about five years ago I began seeing patients with SYNGAP1 mutations and began characterizing their neurodevelopmental trajectory and their neurologic phenotypes and one of the first things that we did was was very simple which is just what we do routinely in clinic just to ask about development and ask when a child with the SYNGAP1 mutation sat unaided when they walked unaided when they said their first word etc and began compiling this data and what we found was that for all of the developmental milestones that we asked about there are significant delays on average in kids with SYNGAP1 mutations so you can see in this chart that the average age of first word said is around 36 months or so for our cohort of SYNGAP1 mutation patients whereas the neurotypical kids say their first word somewhere between 10 and 12 months our kids with SYNGAP1 mutations sit unaided around 9 months 9 to 12 months or so on average this is delayed from neurotypical kids which is around 6 months our kids walk a little bit later the neurotypical kids walking in about 22 to 23 months on average and then fine motor skill development is also significantly delayed in terms of being able to scribble with a pen or pencil and using utensils so this is this is basically retrospective data asking parents to recall when they perform these milestones for the first time and we really wanted to do this in a more rigorous way and so to do this we began I began collaborating with developmental pediatricians at Texas Children's Hospital to longitudinally record development in children with SYNGAP1 mutations and the tool that we use is something called the caputi scales this is basically a play assessment where we have these toys shown here on the left we ask the the children to perform certain tasks things like this form board here where they just place a circle a triangle and square in the in the board stacking blocks drawing lines etc and we do this every year for our children with SYNGAP1 mutations to in a longitudinal way see how children with SYNGAP1 develop over time. </p><p>And so we've been collecting this data again for the past five years this is an update from our publication in 2019 and what we found was really for all domains of development that on average our SYNGAP1 kids have are significantly delayed compared to neurotypical kids so just to orient you to this graph here on the left the y-axis here are h equivalents that's basically how a child would SYNGAP1 scores on gross motor development and the x-axis here is the chronological age of the child so for a neurotypical child let's say at 50 months on average neurotypical children should score an age equivalence of about 50. And what you can see for our SYNGAP1 kids for gross motor development there's a significant delay again at 50 months and really at every age compared to neurotypical but what you can also see is that children with SYNGAP1 mutations continue to learn throughout their lifetime. So on average the age equivalents for our SYNGAP1 kids increase in terms of gross motor development over time and that's why it's vitally important that while we're waiting for the development of these targeted therapies for children with SYNGAP1 mutations that all children with neurodevelopment disorders including SYNGAP1 continue to receive the therapies that can best enhance their development and as I'll show you in terms of gross motor, fine motor as well as language development. Shown here on the right is what's called the developmental quotient. This is basically taking the age equivalence dividing by the chronological age and what you can see is that over time this line on the right goes down. The average developmental quotient. This does not mean that children with SYNGAP1 mutations all regress uniformly at all. What this means is that the distance between where a child with the SYNGAP1 mutation scores and that of neurotypical kids widens with time. </p><p>So not only are children with SYNGAP1 mutations delayed but there is a reduction in the tempo by which learning occurs over time. However it's very important to realize that learning continues throughout the life, throughout the childhood of these kids as we see here on the left with improving age equivalence on gross motor development. Same is true for fine motor development. I won't go into so much detail but again we see a delay in fine motor development on average in our kids with SYNGAP1 mutations and then also for language development as well. One of the things that we've noticed and you can see this really most clearly here for language is that while on average there's a significant delay in language development for kids with SYNGAP1 mutations there's really quite a large scatter and the reason for this large scatter is not really clear. We're looking into whether the location of the mutation in SYNGAP1 may play a role and whether a child is higher on this curve than other children with similar mutations in other parts of the SYNGAP1 gene, whether other factors play a role and this is work that's ongoing in my group. So delayed development is certainly one of the hallmarks of mutations in SYNGAP1. </p><p>The second very common phenotype are seizures. At least 90% of children with loss of function mutations in SYNGAP1 have seizures greater than 90% in the cohort that II follow at Texas Children's Hospital have seizures and we looked in detail as to what type of seizures these kids have. And so in our cohort and others that have been published as well, we see that atypical absence seizures tend to be the most common type of seizure identified. Greater than 60% of the kids that I see in clinic report having atypical absence seizures. So these are seizures they're basically associated with staring spells and they can also be associated with things like eye fluttering or eyelid what's called eyelid myoclonia. In addition to atypical absence seizures we also very frequently see atonic seizures in our kids with SYNGAP1 mutations. These are drop attacks. These are very short but can be very devastating seizures because the children have complete loss of tone and that can result in significant injuries depending on where the child is when the seizure occurs. We also fairly frequently see myoclonic seizures and sometimes generalized tonic clonic seizures and again sometimes these seizures occur in combination, so an individual child with with a SYNGAP1 mutation will not necessarily have just one type of seizure but they but may have multiple types of seizures. Most common are atypical absence seizures and atonic seizures. In fact these can occur in very close approximation. So shown here on the right is a video from Ingrid Sheffer's group in their paper in Neurology and what you can see in this video is that this child has an atypical absence seizure with eye fluttering and that suddenly converts into an atonic seizure where she has loss of tone and you also notice that this is associated with eating which seems to be a fairly common occurrence in children with SYNGAP1 mutations where they can have what's termed a \"reflex seizure\". That is a seizure in response to chewing or eating. </p><p>So since seizures are so common what medications work really well for children with SYNGAP1 mutations? And to really understand this in the best way we need prospective data looking at individual medications as to whether they are efficacious in a blinded fashion in patients with SYNGAP1. But what we did is just looked retrospectively at what medications children that I see in clinic are taking and whether the parents report that there are efficacious or not and for whether a medication is effective we use a commonly used standard which is the seizure burden reduced by at least 50 percent. So what you see in my clinic is that the most commonly prescribed medication that I found to be efficacious is lamotrigine. Many of my patients take lamotrigine and see a positive effect. Although you will see that while two-thirds of patients on lamotrigine have some reduction, have significant reduction in their seizure burden, there are about a third or so of kids that either do not have a significant reduction in their seizure burden or have significant side effects associated with lamotrigine. In addition, the benzodiazepines which include things like clobazam and clonazepam seem to be particularly efficacious in our group of patients and then there are some medications that appear to particularly not work well in kids with SYNGAP1 and these include things like the sodium channel blockers, oxcarbazepine as well as lacosamide and rufinamide. </p><p>So again this is retrospective data looking at the medication use in kids that I see. Going forward what we really need is more prospective data looking at these medications both in terms of their effectiveness in seizures as well as in other phenotypes in kids with SYNGAP1 mutations. So since patients with SYNGAP1 mutations so frequently have seizures they also frequently undergo EEGs and these are, you know, usually outpatient EEGs that last for about an hour. Occasionally kids that I see will have longer EEGs to determine the total seizure burden and to characterize events and determine whether they are in fact seizures or not. I just want to show you an example of an EEG here on the right. This is an EEG from a neurotypical individual. See all of these squiggly lines from different leads that are placed on the scalp shown here on the left and some of the abnormalities that we see in kids with SYNGAP1 mutations most commonly, the most common abnormalities seem to occur in the back of the brain or the occipital region. We don't really know why this is and this seems to be a very unique feature of the EEG abnormalities that we see in kids with SYNGAP1 mutations. Shown here is an EEG in a child with SYNGAP1 mutation who is having an atypical absence seizure. So in the first part of the tracing here you see really what is a normal EEG pattern with low amplitude high frequency waves and then about 10 seconds or so into this recording you see suddenly the EEG changes dramatically where in basically every lead you see these high amplitude low frequency waves that were associated with the behavioral arrest and this behavioral arrest is an atypical absence seizure with freezing of behavior and eyelid myoclonia. Another feature that's not associated with seizures but that we do see fairly frequently in kids with SYNGAP1 mutations are these occipital intermittent rhythmic delta activities. So shown here this tracing looks somewhat similar in that you see these high amplitude low frequency waves but in this case you really only see them in a few of the leads, not in every lead and what's interesting here is that the child from which this EEG was recorded was behaving as they normally do. So despite having this markedly abnormal EEG, this did not result in a seizure and so again we don't understand why this particular pattern seems to be prevalent in kids with SYNGAP1 mutations. SynGAP is expressed all throughout the brain. It's not just expressed in the back of the brain. So why exactly we see this pattern we don't really know but this is a very typical pattern for kids with SYNGAP1 mutations and almost pathomonic for these kids. </p><p>So we've talked about development. We've talked about seizures. Behavioral abnormalities are also very common in kids with SYNGAP1 mutations. In our group of patients we see most commonly aggressive behaviors in our children followed by self-injurious behaviors as well as hyperactivity. I also included in these behavior abnormalities elevated pain tolerance which is very high. About 50 percent of parents report that their children have elevated pain tolerance where things that should really cause significant distress really do not cause issues and then about 50% of the kids in our cohort take medications because of the behavioral abnormalities and some of the medicines that we use in my clinic, and again this is retrospective data, include things like guanfacine and clonidine. These are both originally developed as blood pressure medicines. They don't actually work that well for blood pressure but have been found to be useful for behavioral outbursts, for hyperactivity behaviors and they seem to work fairly well. Stimulants have been tried in several of the kids that I see with SYNGAP1 mutations. Typically seem not to work. In fact they... most of the kids that I see with SYNGAP1 mutations have the opposite effect that you would expect from a stimulant where they become much more hyper or much more aggressive and then a few of the kids that I see also take risperidone which is a antipsychotic medication also approved for behavioral issues in kids with autism. So I'm going to focus on this elevated pain tolerance a bit more and more specifically about sensory processing in general. </p><p>So in 2018 Gavin Rumbaugh's group published this paper where he looked at sensory processing in mice that are heterozygous for a loss of function mutation in Syngap and it's a beautiful paper, very in-depth investigation of this but I just pulled out this one piece of data to show you which where basically what he found was that mice with a mutation in the SYNGAP1 gene are not able to effectively discriminate between two different tactile substances. Two different substances. So shown here in Panel E basically what you see is that in wild type mice they're able to very effectively distinguish an object that they've seen before versus a novel object. In contrast the SYNGAP1 mutant mice are unable to distinguish the two different objects, the object that they've seen before and the novel object. We participated in this not really in the mousework but in identifying a number of individuals with SYNGAP1 mutations whose parents reported that they had significant sensory processing issues and this included things like avoiding loud sounds or seeking certain sensory inputs but this again was really in a retrospective way, just looking through charts, asking parents to give their impression of their child's... overall impression of their child's response to novel stimuli. We wanted to do this in a bit more of a rigorous way and to do this we use something called the Sensory Profile 2. This is basically a structured questionnaire where we ask about different sensory inputs, things including whether children seek certain sensory inputs, whether they try to avoid certain sensory inputs, whether they have a particular sensitivity or lack of sensitivity to certain inputs etc. and we did this both in two groups of patients that I see that includes individuals, children with SYNGAP1 mutations as well as those with a related disorder called Phelan-Mcdermid syndrome and we did this just to see whether these two disorders which in many ways are very similar in terms of development in terms of both increased risk for seizure and then also the proteins that are responsible for these two disorders really work kind of hand in hand in neuronal communication. So we were interested in whether for sensory processing whether there were similarities or differences between these two neurodevelopmental disorders. And what we found for both Phelan-Mcdermid syndrome and for our kids with SYNGAP1 mutations is that there is remarkable... there were remarkable abnormalities in sensory processing in both of these groups. So for each of these graphs the black bars represent individuals with Phelan-Mcdermid syndrome, the blue bars individuals with SYNGAP1 mutations and then the green shaded region here represents the scores of typically developing responders. And what you can see is for each of these domains that we measured seeking sensitivity avoiding and registration of novel sensory inputs that on average kids with both Phelan-Mcdermid syndrome and SYNGAP1 mutations have significant abnormalities in their processing of sensation. </p><p>So similarly to sensory processing, a large percentage of our kids that I see in clinic and that have been reported in the literature with SYNGAP1 mutations have sleep abnormalities. This seems to be greater than 50% at greater than 50 percent of kids with with SYNGAP1 mutations. So we want to again look at this in a rigorous way and to do this we used a another tool called the Childhood Sleep Habits Questionnaire where we again compared kids with mutations in SYNGAP1 versus Phelan-Mcdermid syndrome versus healthy controls. And what we found was that our patients with SYNGAP1 mutations their overall score was significantly higher on this structured questionnaire compared to healthy controls and actually compared to those kids with Phelan-Mcdermid syndrome who also, whose parents also frequently report abnormalities with sleep. So just to orient you, for total score a score of 41 or less is considered to be a child without significant sleep abnormalities and a score greater than 41 the child has significant sleep abnormalities. So again you see that kids with SYNGAP1 mutations on average have a significantly higher score than the healthy controls and significantly higher than this cut-off score of 41. So what's driving this overall score? The sleep questionnaire measures multiple potential abnormalities in sleep including things like night awakenings, sleep duration, sleep onset etc. and what we found for our patients with SYNGAP1 mutations is that nighttime awakenings, sleep durations, and things called parasomnias and these are things like restless leg syndrome, all of these seem to be significantly worse. The scores for these categories seem to be significantly worse in kids with SYNGAP1 mutations compared to healthy controls. </p><p>We wanted to look at this in a bit more detail to see whether the age of the child for which the parents were answering the questionnaire impacted overall score of any of these domains and what we found was that overall for SYNGAP1 kids there really was not much difference whether the child was under 10 years of age or over 10 years of age and this was actually different than what we saw for Phelan-Mcdermid syndrome where younger children seem to have more typical sleep patterns and older children seem to with Phelan-Mcdermid syndrome develop those worsening sleep patterns and this was and when you look at the score of individual domains what we found is that for some domains such as for parasomnias we again saw that whether a child with a SYNGAP1 mutation was under 10 or 10 years or over a similar pattern in the reported frequency of parasomnias. In contrast there were some areas where the sleep pattern seemed to be different in SYNGAP1 kids whether they were under 10 years of age or over 10 years of age. So for example in sleep onset delay those kids under 10 years of age didn't have more sleep on set delay than those kids over 10 years of age with SYNGAP1 mutations. In contrast for sleep anxiety those kids under 10 years of age tend to not have... parents did not report significant amount of sleep anxiety on average compared to those kids over 10 years of age where there was a significant amount of sleep anxiety. </p><p>So the next thing that we're doing in terms of sleep is to look now in a more prospective way using something called actigraphy at sleep patterns in kids with SYNGAP1 mutations. So actigraphy basically uses... it's kind of like a smart watch that measures movement in children both during the daytime and while they're sleeping. <br>Movement of course is reduced significantly during sleep and the watch can, the software can record when sleep's occurring which is shown in these light blue areas of the recording compared to wakefulness and active wakefulness which is shown with this yellow bar showing activity. And what we found overall for kids so far (and this study is still ongoing) what we've found so far is that our SYNGAP1 patients while they do on average actually have fairly normal sleep content that their sleep is inconsistent. So what you can see in the first day here is that this child with a SYNGAP1 mutation only slept about four or five six hours or so. The next day they slept about eight or nine hours and then down at the bottom there was a night where this child only slept three to two to three hours or three to four hours or so. In contrast their neurotypical sibling you can see that every night their onset of sleep, their offset of sleep, their sleep duration is fairly consistent. So just to show you that in terms of numbers if you'll focus here in this middle column, the total sleep, if you look at the average, the average sleep for the SYNGAP1 patient was actually pretty normal. It's about eight hours and actually quite similar to their neurotypical sibling but then if you look in more detail at the consistency of their sleep the minimum amount of time they slept was only about three hours and then the maximum time that they slept on a given night was 12 hours. In contrast the neurotypical sibling is much more consistent sleeping between six to eight hours every night and so, you know, this just shows that while on average using this sort of tool this child may sleep in normal... have a normal sleep content, on any given night you really don't know whether this child is going to have a good night or a bad night whether they're going to sleep a short amount of time or have a good sleep pattern. </p><p>Okay. So I'm going to move on to the next study that were that we've been working on now for a number of years which is to really look in some detail at gait in children with SYNGAP1 mutations. So as I mentioned very early in my talk, gross motor development is significantly abnormal and significantly delayed in kids with SYNGAP1 mutations. But in addition to that even once children with SYNGAP1 develop are able to walk or able to run, their gait as reported by parents or is observed by neurologists is significantly different than that seen in neurotypical children. But we wanted to look at this in a more quantitative way as a potential clinical endpoint and to do this we're using something called motion capture gait analysis and what this is is basically having these reflective balls placed at various joints on an individual either with a SYNGAP1 mutation or a neurotypical child and they're recording gait or walking either on over a carpet, over a flat surface, or on a treadmill and then various<br>data points are recorded using an array of cameras placed around either the carpet or the the treadmill. So this is what the gait lab looks like. This is a flat carpet here that we have children walk over usually around 20 times or so. This carpet is actually not just a simple carpet. It has sensors in it that allow us to detect things like the force with which a heel strike occurs, the length of a stride etc and then those reflective balls which are recorded by the array of cameras also allow us to look at things like joint angles and then so we do the gait analysis again both on this carpet as well as on a treadmill. This treadmill is also not a just a typical treadmill. It can also record things like force of heel striking and things like that. And so this is the sort of raw data that we get from these studies. Basically shown here in this top panel you can see the individual reflective balls are now these red and gray balls and that are connected by lines from the hip down to the leg, the knee and the foot and basically using this system we can record again things like stride length, time it takes for individual strides, joint angles etc. and then the overall goal here is to compare a cohort of kids with SYNGAP1 mutations with neurotypical controls.</p><p>So shown here is just data from a pair of children from a single family, one child with a SYNGAP1 mutation and their neurotypical sibling and what you can see is you can record things like mean stride times again things like mean stride lengths. We're just beginning to look at this data unfortunately, I know a lot of you are interested in the study and some of you have participated in this study, the gait lab has been shut down because of COVID but we're hopeful that in the new year as vaccines become available and our infection rate goes down that we'll be able to reopen the lab and collect the rest of this data. So what does this all mean in terms of in terms of patient outcomes? So we wanted to look at this using something called health health-related quality of life and this again is a structured way of looking at various domains that contribute to quality of life and these include things like school performance, physical performance, emotional well-being, psychosocial performance and socialization and so we looked at again at our patients not just the patients that I see in clinic but actually patients from around the country with SYNGAP1 mutations and compare them to individuals with other neurodevelopmental disorders including Rett syndrome and Phelan-Mcdermid syndrome again as well as published data from individuals with idiopathic autism, idiopathic intellectual disability as well as other chronic health conditions and healthy controls. </p><p>And what we found using this study, using this tool is that kids with SYNGAP1 mutations parents report significant impairment in their health-related quality of life compared to healthy controls and actually similar to those individuals with other syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders such as Phelan-Mcdermid syndrome and Rett syndrome and the scores seen in the kids with SYNGAP1 mutations and these other syndromic autisms is actually significantly lower than those of idiopathic autism as well as idiopathic intellectual disability. So we wanted to dive into this a bit more and we looked at the individual domains that are measured by this health-related quality of life tool and what we found is that for some of the domains such as for socialization our kids with SYNGAP1 mutations with Rett syndrome with Phelan-Mcdermid syndrome have similar impairment as those individuals with idiopathic autism with idiopathic intellectual disability. What is really driving down the score of these for these kids with syndromic autism is their physical performance. So individuals especially with Rett syndrome but also with SYNGAP1 mutations as well as Phelan-Mcdermid syndrome have significantly more impairment in their physical well-being than those kids with idiopathic autism or idiopathic intellectual disability. I think that just goes back to the earlier data that I showed you where these kids, especially with SYNGAP1 mutations, have a significant delay in development of their gross motor milestones and then again even after those milestones are achieved continue to have impairment in their gross motor functioning and their fine motor functioning. Okay.</p><p>So I'm going to change gears now and move from the clinical realm more to the basic science realm. So we've been interested for a number of years in developing human neurons from patients with SYNGAP1 mutations as well as from other neurodevelopmental disorders to try to understand better the pathophysiology that leads to the phenotypes we see in patients and also as a platform for potentially validating interventions that we identify in the lab that eventually we would like to translate to the clinic. So to do this for SYNGAP1 patients we've done this now for a number of patients with SYNGAP1, we simply draw blood from our patient, isolate a particular cell type in the blood called the PBMC. We then take those PBMCs expand them and infect them with a particular type of virus that leads to expression of what are called the Yamanaka factors. These are factors that allow for somatic cells, that that is cells that have terminally differentiated or now blood cells and are always going to be blood cells we were able to reverse their differentiation and get them to a more immature state which is a stem cell state. And then from those stem cells we're able to differentiate those into anything we want in the lab and of course for SYNGAP1 we're interested in developing neurons and investigating the impact of SYNGAP1 mutations on neuronal function. So again this just shows us sort of in picture form what we do. We expand these PBMCs. We reprogram them to develop stem cells. We do quality control with these stem cells to validate that these are in fact what we call pluripotent that is they can develop into any type of cell that we want and then we differentiate these into neurons. Importantly for for these type of studies we have to not only create stem cells from, derive them from patient blood but we also have to create the proper controls for any sort of experiments that we do. </p><p>So for these type of studies we have to correct the mutation that is present in the stem cells that comes from the patient in SYNGAP1. Snd so to do this we use something called CRISPR gene editing. This basically allows us to hone in on the mutation that is present in the patients in the stem cells that we've differentiated from blood in SYNGAP1 and convert it back to the wild type sequence. So this is actually... although I kind of show it here in one slide maybe it looks fairly simple this is actually by far the most arduous part of these studies is getting these corrected stem cells so that we can differentiate neurons from the patient and then from the corrected stem cells to directly compare. And so we've done this now for one of the patients that we collected blood from and generated iPSCs and some of that data shown here just showing that we were able to correct the mutation. </p><p>We're now, these stem cells are undergoing additional quality control experiments including things like exome sequencing to make sure we didn't introduce mutations elsewhere in the genome as well as some of the other quality control work that we do with these stem cells but while we were generating these stem cells from patients with SYNGAP1 mutations we began a collaboration again with Gavin Rumbaugh to look at neurons that are, human neurons that are completely deficient for SynGAP. That is that they have mutations in both copies of the SYNGAP1 gene. So his lab, again using CRISPR gene editing was able to introduce mutations into one of the exons of SYNGAP1 into exon 7 where many human mutations have been identified. He introduced mutations again into both copies of the SYNGAP1 gene that resulted in complete loss or nearly complete loss of the SynGAP protein and that resulted shown here on the right again by protein by western blotting in greater than 90 percent reduction in SynGAP protein. So he sent us these cells to begin to look at neurophysiology, to try to understand whether complete loss of SynGAP results in similar phenotypes as have been seen in mouse neurons. So to do this we use a system called MEA or multi-electrode array where we basically plated the neurons that are completely deficient for SynGAP or wild-type control neurons on a plate where we have multiple electrodes that can record spontaneous activity. So shown here in Panel A are just some of the neurons from one of the Syngap mutant lines that are plated on these electrodes. You can see here in Panel B recordings from neurons that completely lack SynGAP or that are wild type or have wild type sequence for Syngap. And then shown at the bottom here are individual recordings from the SynGAP deficient neurons and wild type controls. And I think what's really easy to see here these black lines indicate individual firing events. You can see in the neurons labeled homo1 and homo2 that there's a significant increase in the firing rate of neurons deficient for SynGAP compared to wild type control shown at the bottom. And that's true both at the level of individual neurons as well as in groups of neurons. So the pink lines here indicate that groups of neurons are firing altogether at the same time and what you can see is that in the SynGAP deficient neurons we have a lot of neurons that are firing together in both types of deficient neurons. You see a lot of firing in both of these neurons compared to wild type controls where we rarely see this coordinated firing at this age of neurons. </p><p>So again this indicates that complete loss of SynGAP results in excessive firing and excessive excitability of neurons compared to two wild type neurons. So why is this? So Gavin's group looked at this in a bit more detail and asked whether there might be a difference in the morphology of the neurons deficient for SynGAP compared to wild-type controls and found that those neurons that are deficient for SynGAP are significantly larger than the wild type controls and this is primarily and this is due to the fact that extensions from the neurons which are called neurites these are the processes through which neurons communicate with each other are significantly longer in the knockout neurons compared to the wild type neurons and we think that it's this excess excessive growth of these neurites of the dendrite of these dendrites of these neurons that leads to increased connectivity between neurons and the excessive firing that we see in the knockout neurons compared to the wild type neurons. So we've started to look at patient-derived neurons. We began while we were in the process of making these isogenic controls from our SYNGAP1 patients we decided to go ahead and do some recording from a SYNGAP1 patient and compare it to a neurotypical individual which is S3-084 here and then from these neurons that completely lack SynGAP which is Knock Out 38 here and what you can see in this very preliminary data is that the patient-derived neurons S3-059 have increased firing compared to those neurons from a neurotypical individual but not to the extent of neurons completely deficient for SYNGAP1. So again this is work that's ongoing now that it appears we have the isogenic controls we're going to begin looking at this in more detail in our patient line versus the corrected lines and we're also beginning to perform the same sort of gene editing in additional patient lines so that we can determine the severity of excessive firing that we see in different patient lines.</p><p>Okay. So I'm going to end with just a few slides about different modes of targeted therapies for neurodevelopmental disorders and I will say I'm going to go over just a couple of of types of therapies that I think might be particularly important for families that of children with SYNGAP1 that they've been thinking about or heard about<br>but this is an area that is really exciting to me because when I started my training in neurology about 10 years ago or so there really was nothing available for any neurodevelopmental disorder and just in the last five years a number of either gene replacement therapies or antisense oligonucleotides have become available for a number of neurodevelopmental disorders and I think this is something that is just going to continue to grow for the kids that I see. So I'll really focus on just a couple of types of therapy that might be pertinent for children with SYNGAP1 and that is in vivo gene replacement which is typically viral based as well as antisense oligonucleotides. </p><p>So gene replacement therapy as it's commonly studied these days uses a particular type of virus called adeno-associated virus and the reason this is used is because this virus tends to not elicit a strong immune response. It's something that unlike other viruses that have been used in the past such as adenovirus which does elicit a fairly strong immune response that can be detrimental to the individual that receives it. AAV does not have this issue. The other thing about AAV is that it can be administered in a number of ways. </p><p>So one way is directly into the brain which is called intraparenchymal. So this is a method where small holes, spur holes are drilled into the skull and then viruses administered directly into the brain. The virus can dissipate from where it's injected somewhat although this is one of the limitations is that it does not tend to infect all of the cells in the brain. AAV can also be administered into the ventricles or the fluid-filled spaces within the brain. This allows for the virus to circulate throughout the brain, so potentially can interact with more regions of the brain. However it only interacts with those regions that are directly bathed in this fluid. Again, one of the limitations of this approach. For certain disorders, for neuromuscular disorders an infection within the muscle might be beneficial and then for a particular type of AAV intravascular administration might be beneficial although there are some some caveats to that. So gene replacement therapy for neurodevelopmental disorders really came of age with this paper but in 2017 which was the first clinical trial that really definitively showed that a gene replacement strategy could be beneficial for a neurodevelopment disorder. In this case Spinal Muscular Atrophy. So shown here on the left is the first three patients that were administered an AAV that expressed the gene that's mutated in SMA which is SMN1 and then on the right a higher dose was administered to a much larger cohort of individuals and what you can see is basically most children with SMA on this score which is called the CHOP INTEND score score lower than 40. And what that means is they're basically not developing gross motor milestones normally. Kids with SMA, the natural history of the disorder is that these children with the most severe type never sit up, never roll over and typically pass away at a very early age. What was so exciting about this study is that nearly every child that was administered the higher dose of this gene replacement therapy did much better than the natural history studies would indicate that they should have done. And so this was very exciting because first example of a neurodevelopmental disorder that could be treated using this approach. </p><p>However there are some caveats with this sort of therapy. So one of them is that if an individual has existing immunity to the type of AAV that's being administered, the immune system will prevent that virus from infecting its target cells. They'll basically sequester it away. This is the natural immune response that we all develop to viruses. So for example either if someone becomes infected for example with the flu or if someone is immunized against measles this is the immune response that develops that prevents a second infection. So in individuals that have an established immune response to the particular AAV that's being developed for a given neurodevelopmental disorder, if that immune response is already present in the child that AAV will not infect the target cells instead will be sequestered away through the immune system. And as you can see in this graph especially if you look at children over eight years of age for most of the types of AAV most kids develop, over half of the kids in the study develop immunity to most of the AAV serotypes. </p><p>So this although this is very promising this might be something that is most promising for very young children and children over the age of eight or so are likely to have been been exposed to many of the stereotypes of AAV and this is potentially not quite as useful for those children. The other issue again that I mentioned before is that getting the AAV to infect every cell within the brain. So it really depends on the disorder whether this is important or not. For SYNGAP1 this is likely to be very important and the reason is most if not nearly every neuron within the brain expresses SynGAP and it's important that these neurons express the right amount of SynGAP. So having just 50 percent less SynGAP than normal results in the disorder the SYNGAP1 intellectual disability disorder. We also know that having too much at least in cultured neurons is detrimental to the function of those neurons. We don't know yet in model organisms or or in humans whether that is true as well. So it's important to get every neuron to express the right amount of SynGAP. Most of the... well all of the AAVs that are used currently are being investigated as a gene therapy vehicle are not able to infect every neuron. Even if the virus is placed directly into the brain it's still placed into only a few spots within the brain and diffuses only a short distance away. Those AAVs that can be administered for example systemically through the blood and they can cross the blood-brain barrier those only infect about one percent, one to two percent of the neurons in the brain. So again this is a limitation of the current AAV technologies. Something that's being worked on but something to keep in mind in terms of development of gene therapy, gene replacement therapies for neurodevelopmental disorders. The other thing is that it really seems for most neurodevelopmental disorders that age matters. That is the age at which the therapy is administered has a significant impact on the improvement of phenotypes. So this is just one study that looked at that for a disorder called mucopolysaccharidosis. A gene replacement therapy was administered intraparenchymally into four children of various ages from about 20 months of age to a little over 50 months of age and what you can see in the small clinical trial is that the child that's administered the earliest at 20 months of age seemed to do the best. Their developmental trajectory actually paralleled that of neurotypical child. Whereas the child that was administered to therapy the latest at 50 months they did see some improvement in terms of their development, in terms of not regressing to the same degree as was seen in the natural history study but still not in line with the development of neurotypical kids. </p><p>Okay and then I'm going to talk about antisense oligonucleotides. This is again something that's very promising for a number of neurodevelopmental disorders and I think something that certainly a lot of my families talk to me about whether this is something that could be used for kids with SynGAP and I think there is a lot of promise for this. So just to kind of orient you to molecular biology so all genes are encoded by DNA including SYNGAP1. This DNA is translated into mRNA this is sort of an intermediate step leading to the final product which is the SynGAP protein. Antisense oligonucleotides as they were originally developed were a method for decreasing expression of a protein. So shown here is a typical mRNA. When an antisense oligonucleotide binds to this mRNA, binds to the middle of this mRNA it's degraded and this results in a reduction in protein production. Obviously this is not what you want for SYNGAP1 but antisense oligonucleotides can work in different ways depending on how they're developed. So again the sort of classical way is to decrease expression through mRNA degradation but it's also possible to alter which exons are included in the final transcript product and therefore the type of protein that's made or for SYNGAP1 what's most promising is that you can target other parts of the mRNA or other molecules to actually increase the abundance of a given protein. </p><p>So one way is to sequester something called microRNAs that normally regulate protein production but other things that can be targeted include things called natural antisense transcripts or poison exons. These are regulatory mechanisms to the cells normally have, neurons normally have, to precisely regulate how much protein is present. In an individual with a loss of function mutation in Syngap it would be beneficial to increase the amount of protein. So using antisense oligonucleotides to target antisense transcripts which normally decrease the amount of SYNGAP1 could lead to an increase in its overall abundance or as a recent paper showed targeting what are called poison exons which also lead to degradation of mRNA and prevent protein translation. Targeting those poison exons could also potentially increase SynGAP abundance. And then I just wanted to show the one example or probably the best known example of an antisense oligonucleotide for neurodevelopmental disorder again for SMA where in this case they're not trying to decrease the amount of a protein but they're actually trying to increase the amount of a certain protein product and to do this they use an antisense oligonucleotide that alters the protein that's made from a related gene to the gene that causes SMA which is SMN2 and results in what is nearly a normal protein product from this copy of SMN1. ASOs can be administered also in a number of ways. They can be administered directly into the brain They can be administered through a spinal tap. There's some work going on to look at whether they can be administered intranasally or systemically. For SYNGAP1 because the most prominent phenotype is cognitive and seizures it's likely the intraventricular administration would be necessary and I just want to give you an example of how this would potentially be done. </p><p>This is shows you a medication that is now used for a disorder called ceroid lipofuscinoses. This is not an ASO. It's an enzyme product. Nevertheless this is potentially a similar mechanism would be used in individuals with a cognitive neurodevelopmental disorder where a port is placed directly into the ventricle of a brain and then a biological substance could be administered either an enzyme in this case or an ASO for other neurodevelopmental disorders. So this is, you know, obviously this is very exciting because children with this particular disorder have significant improvement in their development but there are also challenges with this. Having a port that's permanently connected directly to your brain can result in infections from the outside world getting into the brain and significant hospitalizations and illnesses associated with it. So with all of these while there's a lot of promise there are also potential challenges that need to be overcome. Okay. So I think I may have gone over just a couple of minutes. So I'll just quickly say that, you know, what we've been looking for and what I talked about today or trying to understand what clinical endpoints or biomarkers might be meaningful for clinical trials certainly sensory perception appears to be one that would be very important to look at. Sleep abnormalities could be a very important endpoint. Seizure activity, EEG, particularly EEG findings such as these posterior generalized discharges could be important. Behavioral outbursts and other behavioral abnormalities and of course developmental delay and intellectual disability, cognitive outcomes and then for SYNGAP1, you know, I think we can't rule out using things like small molecule modulators for example for SynGAP protein stability. Something that Gavin's been working on for a number of years. Our lab is also looking at genetic modifiers of SynGAP protein stability as potential entry points. ASOs have a lot of promise although some of the caveats I mentioned. Still I think the jury's out about gene replacement technologies. I think we need new technologies in that regard and then I'm asked very frequently about stem cells. At this point there are... it's not clear evidence that stem cell transplantation would have any impact in children with SYNGAP1. I think there needs to be a lot more research in this regard.</p><p>So I want to end by thanking all the families that are on the call, all of the families that have participated in our research studies. You guys are what drive me every day and also of course all the funding sources especially the SynGAP Research Fund have been very generous and helped us with launched the neuron work that we've been doing in the lab. So I will end there and I went over so I don't know if there's time for questions or not but I'm happy to stick around. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;That's very kind of you. Thank you and thank you for the presentation. We lost a few people at the bottom of the hour but there's a few families on. If you are a parent or an SRF member who wants to talk I can put you up on the panel. I'm happy to do that. First, Dr Holder thanks. That was quite a tour de force and a great overview. I think the thing about the age is going to bum people out and I think the thing about the needle in the brain maybe it's just recency because it's the last slide I just saw but there's a bit of a head twister too because I think people were getting their head wrapped around intrathecal for ASO. So I would have a question on both of them. Why do you think it would be that versus intrathecal? Just to ensure widespread delivery? And then on the age thing I'm sure you're following this too, the recent Angel- FAST, the Angelman organization just published some pretty breathless initial readouts from the docs about wow we didn't think... I mean the one that stuck in my head was \"we didn't think the brain was this plastic\" this is remarkable. So I totally understand as a clinician who's got desperate and tired parents like myself coming into your lab your job is to be clear-eyed with us but is there also room to say there's still stuff we don't know? Not to put words in your mouth but just to stay balanced?</p><p>Dr Holder:&nbsp;Oh there... absolutely. That is absolutely true. So you know I just, I wanted to put that out there as something that is probably a factor but it's... if I made it seem like, you know, after a certain age there's no hope I did not mean to do that. I think it plays a factor. That there is a, you know, an age is a factor in the efficacy of these therapies but from animal models and, you know, from some very preliminary data as you were talking about from patients what's clear is the brain is very plastic and there is room for improvement and that's why you know when when I talk about therapies you notice I never use the word cure right? I'm not trying to say I'm going to develop the cure and everyone just wait, you know, it's coming. I think what we need and what we can achieve in the near future are therapies that improve quality of life, improve symptoms for our patients with SYNGAP1 as well as for other neurodevelopmental disorders. That's what I'm working towards and while age is a factor that's just one factor. There are many other factors. I think potentially almost equally as important is combining these personalized therapies with traditional therapies with the speech therapy, with physical therapy, with fine motor therapy, with ABA therapy it's that's going to be really critical is not to expect that there's going to be a pill that's going to reverse everything, to really get a comprehensive therapy.</p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Thanks for that. Can you see the Q&amp;A? There's a few questions that came up. JR has been prolific as usual and then Rebecca has some questions and it looks like we have one person who's got a question about one of your papers from their class. </p><p>Dr Holder:&nbsp;Okay. Let me read these. So to Dr Holder how do you suggest identifying doctors in a variety of regions educated and ready to focus on Syngap patients? Pediatric and adult? Super hard and I'm getting referrals still from all over the country and calls you know, \"I have this kid with a Syngap mutation what do I do?\" and those are you know very, very frequent. Certainly I'm not sure where you are exactly but the larger medical centers are more likely to have individuals that are somewhat versed in these rare neurogenetic disorders but you know it's Syngap mutations were again only identified 11 years ago. So it's a difficult... it's very difficult and I can tell you in Houston what to do but it's harder around the country. I fully realize that. Second question... oh sorry go ahead? </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;I just want to pile on to that because it is something that you know, as a patient advocacy group we get the newly diagnosed parents and some of them are next to big centers like your own and I say go find a neuro who's if they haven't seen a Syngap look for someone who's seen Dravet or Angelman or some big disease because at least they have a clue as what the genetic epilepsy might look like. Sure. But when I talk to people who are in the more remote areas that don't have access to great you know cadres of neurologists I urge them to travel but we're going to see more and more kids and we're going to see more and more adults. Right? We're already seeing a handful of adults in fact we just found a 65 year old like a month ago we were making a movie about. How do you as one of the... and you I mean if I think about like who knows which clinicians are leading clinician-scientists are leading the charge on thinking about how to address Syngap in patients in clinic, it's it's really you and Dr Connie top the list along with others like Dr Poduri but as there's an explosion of diagnosed patients what is the way the medical industry works to take the knowledge from you and Dr Connie and share that? Is it just you publishing papers? Is it a seminar? Is it continuing at AES? Like, because we were expecting a bit of a hockey stick but how do we catch the clinicians up? </p><p>Dr Holder:&nbsp;Yeah, so that's a great question. I certainly try to do my part to educate through those platforms and Connie does as well. Part of it is you know, the younger generations of physicians are just becoming more versed in these neurogenetic disorders and they're becoming more comfortable with, you know, reading about them and trying to understand them. It's a steep road though. I mean even something that's been around for a long time that, you know, like Rett syndrome that more people know about, you know, depending on your practice you may only have one child with Rett syndrome and so you just don't have the expertise. I will say Connie and I, I can speak for myself and I think I can speak for Connie as well we're always happy to speak to your local neurologist and I do this fairly frequently. So that's another way. Certainly, you know, advocacy organizations putting information out there is really important as well.</p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Okay do you want to go back to the questions? </p><p>Dr Holder:&nbsp;Sure. So the next one is how can we find research-based clinicians to study other potential aspects of syngap disorder? Pituitary and enteric nervous system and bladder control sensation? That's... yeah, that's a great question. So I can tell you for the other disorder I study Phelan-Mcdermid syndrome which was first described in the 1980s right, so you're talking about 20, 30 years. For that disorder there only now are coming online GI specialists, endocrinologists that are really studying those aspects of that disorder and so certainly again because Syngap is identified so recently as a cause of neurodevelopment disorder we don't have that yet. As far as I know. We do... we have some interest in GI issues more on the basic science side with Julia Dallman down at University of Miami. Someone that worked with me here at Texas Children's is now in Florida and is helping her kind of more on the clinical side with GI issues. So that's kind of what I'm doing. I'm trying to teach the trainees here and then they go off to the world and hopefully we can just build it that way.</p><p>Mike:&nbsp;And then Rebecca's next question is are you hoping the data from the gait studies could potentially identify undiagnosed kids? This would be a holy grail right? Some way of seeing if someone's Syngapian but without having to go through a genetic panel. </p><p>Dr Holder:&nbsp;Yeah so I think the gait study is probably not going to be specific enough to identify whether a child has a SYNGAP1 mutation versus another mutation in a different neurodevelopmental gene. I'm optimistic. I'm hopeful that you know, I understand the issues with with genetic studies in terms of getting insurance companies to pay for them, in terms of their availability. I'm hoping that that will more and more be available. So for example, an older technology that's still used and diagnosed a lot of kids with Phelan Mcdermid syndrome are chromosome microarrays and as of five years ago it's really hard to get an insurance company to pay for those. Those are now nearly universally paid for by insurance companies. I think exome sequencing will go that way. It's just it takes time because often insurance companies they just put up barriers to try to reduce their costs. You have to prove to them that it's important to get the specific diagnosis and that will still reduce their cost because now you have a better idea of what to focus on. So you kind of have to sell them through the literature basically that it's important to do that so. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Then I'll let you read Rebecca's next question. </p><p>Dr Holder:&nbsp;Mmm okay. So using the gait studies will you correlate with imaging studies that may have identified orthopedic problems in patients to identify prevalence of potential issues for future patients to be aware of? Great question. Not something that we're looking at in this first group of patients. We really just want to define what are the gait abnormalities but then obviously the next question is you know why do these gait abnormalities occur? Is it because of neurologic dysfunction? Is it because of orthopedic issues? That's a good question. Anonymous sends in: in one of my classes this semester we discussed your 2019 paper where you re-express SynGAP in adult mice and found improvements brain function, behavior is curious of theory and progress along this line of treatment? So I will say this is Gavin Rumbaugh's paper. I mean we contributed but it's really his work and so from that paper really you know spraying the work that we're doing now to try to identify genetic modifiers that when inhibited increase SynGAP abundance. So that's kind of the next step from my lab. For the Rumbaugh lab he's looking at compounds that might, small molecule compounds that might increase SynGAP abundance. So yes there is ongoing work related to that study.</p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Okay and then JR, Virginie, Rebecca, Virginie and you're off the hook. </p><p>Marta:&nbsp;Okay I have a question about the EEGs. You know it has come up several times also with Dr Hicks. Do you think the EEGs are gonna be specific enough to have a biomarker on the EEGs? Because it keeps coming up and I think do you have the interest, Doctor Hicks has the interest. Do you think if it's studied properly we get the biomarker from the EEGs? </p><p>Dr Holder:&nbsp;Yeah so I mean there are a lot of different ways you can use EEGs potentially as a biomarker. I talked about some of the common abnormalities that we see in kids with SYNGAP1 mutations. For a another, a different clinical trial that we're doing related to Phelan Mcdermid syndrome we're looking at the frequency of epileptiform discharges. These are these abnormal discharges not associated with seizure but indicative of irritability, you know, that can lead to a seizure. So one thing you can do is you can just look at the frequency of those discharges either in a given individual before and after treatment and see if there's improvement with whatever treatment you're using in combination with other things like seizure frequency. So I think EEGs can be used as a biomarker. I don't think... I'm not sure there's one biomarker, there's one EEG abnormality that will universally work as a biomarker for every individual with Syngap. For example although that posterior intermittent rhythmic delta activity is very common in kids with Syngap mutations it's not universal and it's probably present in 50 to 60 percent of kids with Syngap mutations. So it's, you know, it's frequent enough it could be used but it's not universal. What's more common are these epileptiform discharges and you could look at the frequency of those and see if there's a change but again that- any sort of biomarker has to be coupled with a clinical outcome measure that improves. So you- a clinical trial cannot look just at a biomarker has to, you have to show that there's some improvement in the phenotype that will be clinically meaningful for that child. </p><p>Marta:&nbsp;And another question we I mean we get like in the groups frequently as is in a child I mean being Syngap considered epileptic encephalopathy, if a child has abnormal EEG but doesn't have clinical seizures do you put the do you because some clinicians don't put those childs in anti-epileptic medications and some do. What is your take on that? We get that question sometimes and it's kind of all over the place. </p><p>Dr Holder:&nbsp;Sure. Sure. So one thing is that some of the children that have those abnormal discharges but do not have clinical seizures may develop the clinical seizures in the future depending on their age. But I have definitely seen some kids with Syngap mutations who are older, who are teenagers and have not had any clinical seizures. So for those kids even if they have abnormalities on the their EEG I do not put them on medication. The reason being I don't know how to titrate the medication. So for seizure activity I try to titrate a medicine until there's no seizure activity but for EEG abnormalities most of the time those abnormalities do not disappear with medication. Sometimes they do but most of the time they don't. So then I don't really have an endpoint to which to titrate that medicine to. I think what, you know, still is sort of out for debate and more work needs to be done is whether those EEG abnormalities lead to some of the other phenotypes that we see other than seizure. Do they cause some of the behavioral problems that we see? Do they cause... are they indicative of the severity of intellectual disability or developmental delay? And that's really a research question. So that that's something that needs to be addressed not just for Syngap but for many neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><p>Mike:&nbsp;All right. So the next question was can you speak to how we might learn about the Angelman syndrome ASO trial? Would that disease be similar to Syngap as far as affecting every cell in the brain? </p><p>Dr&nbsp;Holder:&nbsp;So... yes and so it's a complicated question actually because it's an imprinted gene but for all intents and purposes, yes it's every region of the brain is affected in Angelman syndrome similar to Syngap. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Can I actually stop you there? Sure I you.. I realize that it's...we're getting heady here but the Angelman people have a social media machine that I am envious of and everyone knows exactly what's going on in Angelman but that the difference in that whereas we have a variety of mutations in there and imprinted can you just double click once on kind of where it's important to learn from them but we're a little bit different than their disease and this is my editorializing as I do. You can, you're free to disagree or not maybe Dravet a is a better analog and we should be watching them which is something that just in terms of a classic haploinsufficiency, variety of mutations, but Angelman and Dravet get thrown around a lot and if you could just dwell up on that in a minute? </p><p>Dr Holder:&nbsp;Okay. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;I'd appreciate it. </p><p>Dr Holder:&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah so you know both Angelman and Dravet syndrome have a lot of similarities with Syngap in terms of phenotypes, in terms of cognitive development issues, in terms of epilepsy being very frequent in both of those disorders. So in that sense Syngap is very similar. When you drill down to the specific genetic causes of these disorders they're all very different. So Angelman syndrome is primarily due to a mutation in a gene that regulates other proteins. So the gene creates a protein that regulates other proteins. It does so in a different way than SynGAP. So SynGAP does the same thing. It regulates other proteins but only a very small, very specific type of protein called a G protein. Whereas the the gene that we think is primarily responsible for Angelman syndrome, it regulates the stability of other proteins. The genetics are a bit different in that for Syngap the mutations in general probably 90, 80-90% of the mutations are loss of function mutations, point mutation in the gene. So in the end you have 50% reduction of the protein the normal amount of protein that you need. For Angelman syndrome there are a variety of ways that it can occur. You can have point mutations. That that is one way that you can get Angelman syndrome point mutations in the gene called UBE3A can result in the Angelman phenotype. You can have a deletion of the region in which UBE3A is present and that can also result in Angelman syndrome and then you can have abnormalities in imprinting and really it's in the issue here is that you can get what's called diparental parental disomy where instead of getting one copy from mom and one from dad, you get two copies from one parent and that results in the phenotype because of imprinting. For Dravet syndrome there many of the mutations are actually missense mutations that alter the the function of the protein and actually for Dravet the other difference is that particular protein seems to be most important in inhibitory neurons and those neurons become less functional which results in the increased excitation of the brain. Whereas in Syngap it seems to be that the protein... there's some debate here but the protein is most important in excitatory neurons and this function or loss of the normal abundance of SynGAP results in hyper excitation of those excitatory neurons because of an intrinsic dysfunction in those in those neurons. If you had a panel of scientists here they might debate me right and talk about how interneurons are actually really important but I'm going to give you kind of what is generally thought to be the case. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;I appreciate it. I take your point. I mean I'm not saying SCN1A and SYNGAP1 are the same but sort of the classic neuro haploinsufficiency versus Angelman which is a little bit I try to tell people don't assume that we can do what we did in Angelman in Syngap. Like I mean you had on your list the bone marrow transplant. That's a whole other crazy town Angelman thing. Right and there are disorders, there are disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders in children where bone marrow transplantation is the is the clinical standard. So just depends on the disorder which is why we're lucky to have you and others working on our disorder. Okay let's let's keep cruising here. So Rebecca had a question do you see potential benefits of what you've seen nice question Rebecca do you see potential benefits what you've seen of Ciitizen and helping you with so Ciitizen to remind you is we're going to have 100 patients normalizing all their data in one place in an effort to find more of the that fabulous charts you had sort of showing how our kids show up. </p><p>Dr Holder: Yeah so I think it's critically important for a number of reasons one is that there's never going to be one center that sees 100 kids or at least not in the near future in the term in the time span the citizen will be able to aggregate that number of records. So that's really important as you saw from some of what I presented you know you can begin to look at things like medication efficacy and then I know with Ciitizen in particular using machine learning you might be able to make connections that you know the human brain would not necessarily go to. This medication that we use for seizures improves gait for example, something like that and that's what we're using that sort of platform that utilizes machine learning can be very beneficial. You know there are everything has its place and I will say that's not going to replace prospective natural history studies because those use different tools to measure things in a certain way whereas retrospective analysis, you know, you can get more records but then the records are more heterogeneous. Right? So everything has its place and you know I definitely think it's you know the the effort's very important but I want to encourage people not to say well I'm participating in Ciitizens so Dr Holder's questionnaires are useless.</p><p>Mike: I have no no no I would say or sign up for Ciitizens only takes 10 minutes and then you have all your medical records and then go and do all Holders questionnaires because you're going to remember stuff because I've only been diagnosed two and a half years I can't remember a year ago and it is an exciting discussion around these debates and I'm not for a second because you and Ingrid both are quick to correct me on you know the gold standard is a classic natural history study and the reminder I reply with is yeah but those take years and cost millions whereas Ciitizen you know we collected data three months ago people signed up three months ago and Ellie shared a first readout of only 10 but you know we're up to 75 so the number keeps growing last week so the speed if it can help us at all is I think welcome and it's not costing us millions. Thank you very much for for sharing this and for the update. This is a recording we're going to send a lot of new families to go and watch the existing ones as well and we will follow up probably with a link ask you for a link or how people should reach out if they want to participate in these studies that they can. Okay all right thank you so much. Thanks everybody for joining.<br></p>",

Originally shared on July 2nd, 2020. Please find additional Syngap research webinars here: https://syngapresearchfund.org/webinars​</p><p>Dr Shilpa Kadam is an Associate Professor of Neurology with joint appointments at The Kennedy Krieger Institute and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. </p><p>Dr Kadam’s lab is focused on investigating mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis in acquired and genetic developmental disorders like SYNGAP1. The lab is interested in discovering novel drug targets and delivery systems directed at the central nervous system. </p><p>Dr. Kadam has broad clinical exposure to epilepsy management. </p><p>Her work with SYNGAP has been focused on the relationship of poor-quality sleep and epilepsy. Her laboratory was able to identify abnormal underlying brain activity and high incidence of seizure during sleep by examining mouse models and overnight EEG from SynGAP patients. Her laboratory then discovered that using a low dose of Perampanel (<a href=\"https://www.fycompa.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fycompa</a>) may not prevent seizures but can help correct the high-frequency abnormal brain activities during sleep in mice model. This itself may have beneficial effects during sleep of SYNGAP patients. She hopes this approach will lead to a human trial.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(20)30002-0/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">BiologicalPpsychiatryJournal.com/article/S0006-3223(20)30002-0/fulltext</a></p><p>Dr. Kadam is also interested in antisense oligonucleotide therapy ASO to help rescue SynGAP levels in the brain. </p><p>She is currently seeking funding for several projects in SYNGAP with one of the ones more important being on CRISPR/Cas technologies to create mice models to find potential biomarkers.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p>Dr Kadam: My training&nbsp;&nbsp;has been in epilepsy research and it was Dr.&nbsp;Huganir who introduced us to SYNGAP1&nbsp;&nbsp;research and the mouse that the data we will&nbsp; I'll be showing today and we will be discussing is&nbsp;&nbsp;the is the mouse that his lab generated quite a few&nbsp; years ago but it has a very critical mutation&nbsp;&nbsp;in a very critical domain that allows us to&nbsp; study almost the most critical functions for SYNGAP1&nbsp;&nbsp;which has been very well documented by all&nbsp; his early research and continuing research. So&nbsp;&nbsp;what I'm hoping to try and communicate today is&nbsp; how we approach this research. Why did we do it the&nbsp;&nbsp;way we did it and some of the insights that are&nbsp; maybe very novel that might generate new&nbsp;&nbsp;hypotheses that my lab, myself will pursue in the&nbsp; goal of therapies. And as parents you guys know&nbsp;&nbsp;that, you know, understanding how this protein is&nbsp; affecting the brain development is very critical&nbsp;&nbsp;but at the same time if we can try and figure&nbsp; out what new therapies might help improve, even by&nbsp;&nbsp;a little bit, the incidence of seizures in children&nbsp; with SYNGAP1 mutations is also important.So my slides are not moving forward... okay. So&nbsp; all of this information is known to you but&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm going to give you a background just so that&nbsp; you understand what we are focusing on. So just&nbsp;&nbsp;like Sydney said seizures and sleep disorders are&nbsp; predominantly one of the spectrum of SYNGAP1&nbsp;&nbsp;haploinsufficiency and myoclonic and absence&nbsp; seizures are the dominant phenotype both described&nbsp;&nbsp;in Ingrid Scheffer's first cohort study and I see&nbsp; it as the description for all the reports that I&nbsp;&nbsp;get for the EEGs that the parents have sent&nbsp; us copies for so far. And of course in epilepsy&nbsp;&nbsp;research there's a long-standing relationship&nbsp; between epilepsy and sleep problems especially&nbsp;&nbsp;in neuro development disorders. </p><p>So at Kennedy&nbsp; Krieger we have huge focus on Rett Syndrome and&nbsp;&nbsp;and there are many similarities in the sense of&nbsp; the progression of the epilepsy, the progression&nbsp;&nbsp;of the learning disabilities, and some of the&nbsp; sleep disorders that have been reported by&nbsp;&nbsp;parents and have been phenotype by the clinicians&nbsp; who are looking at cohorts of patients with SYNGAP1&nbsp;&nbsp;mutations. Sleep disturbance. I don't have&nbsp; to report it. In 100% of the patients problems&nbsp;&nbsp;are associated with sleep initiation and frequent&nbsp; night awakenings. Early morning seizures has also&nbsp;&nbsp;been reported and so this will become important&nbsp; as we try and describe some of the results we&nbsp;&nbsp;found from the analysis of overnight EEGs that&nbsp; parents have sent us and what we then found in&nbsp;&nbsp;the mouse model. Because for very obvious&nbsp; reasons once we have this phenotype there are&nbsp;&nbsp;certain investigations we can only do in the&nbsp; mice. We cannot do in the children. So that's where&nbsp;&nbsp;translational research becomes so important. So&nbsp; just as a quick background I know many of you have&nbsp;&nbsp;taken your child for clinical EEGs and overnight&nbsp; EEGs so you may have seen some of the trace recordings&nbsp;&nbsp;either given to you in the report or you&nbsp; may have actually seen with the EEG recording&nbsp;&nbsp;and I just wanted to give you a little bit of a&nbsp; background and hopefully you can see my mouse. </p><p>So&nbsp;&nbsp;basically right now we are focusing on wake versus sleep EEG and so wakefulness, the circuits that&nbsp;&nbsp;in our brain that promote wakefulness, usually have&nbsp; these very low voltage, fast oscillation kind of EEG&nbsp;&nbsp;phenotype which is right here. Wakefulness you see&nbsp; there is very low amplitude, high frequency&nbsp;&nbsp;discharges on the EEG. And then there are the three&nbsp; stages of sleep in humans, which is stage one, two&nbsp;&nbsp;and three and you can easily see that as the non-REM sleep, which is non-Rapid Eye Movement sleep,&nbsp;&nbsp;it becomes more dense, you start moving from this&nbsp; low amplitude, high frequency in stage one to this&nbsp;&nbsp;very high amplitude, low frequency type of sleep&nbsp; brainwaves. So these are very characteristic of&nbsp;&nbsp;non-REMs and then we have REM which is Rapid Eye&nbsp; and so the brain alternates between non-REM and&nbsp;&nbsp;REM during our sleep cycles in humans and REM you&nbsp; can see is almost similar to wake. So it's called&nbsp;&nbsp;paradoxical wake, paradoxical sleep&nbsp; because the waveform if you just looked at it&nbsp;&nbsp;and you don't know that the child at that&nbsp; point is awake or asleep on video you might confuse&nbsp;&nbsp;it to being wakefulness but the significant&nbsp; distinction is that a REM will always be&nbsp;&nbsp;between two non-REMs. So when an non-REM ends or&nbsp; REM starts and then a non-REM again progresses&nbsp;&nbsp;from stage 1 to 3 of non-REM and because these&nbsp; are associated with frequency oscillations on&nbsp;&nbsp;how the brain is firing in certain frequencies,&nbsp; I put in this slide on the side in blue which&nbsp;&nbsp;is all a one-second discharge and you can see&nbsp; what we call as \"high frequency oscillation\" which&nbsp;&nbsp;is gamma, which would be the focus of most of the&nbsp; cortical function we are trying to evaluate, both&nbsp;&nbsp;in the mouse and in the human EEGs. And so as you&nbsp; can see, this is high frequency. It's around 30&nbsp;&nbsp;to 100 Hertz. Then there are other oscillations&nbsp; very well defined in the clinic and we try and&nbsp;&nbsp;apply the same rules to the mouse EEG. And so as&nbsp; you go lower in frequency it's the beta, alpha,&nbsp;&nbsp;theta but more importantly, Delta, which is the most&nbsp; predominant, just zero to four Hertz, is the most&nbsp;&nbsp;predominant waveform seen in non-REM stage four.&nbsp; So deep sleep is associated with a high density&nbsp;&nbsp;of delta. High brain activity associated with doing&nbsp; some tasks, being cognitively aroused is associated&nbsp;&nbsp;with high gamma. </p><p>So for this talk we are going to&nbsp; focus on gamma versus delta because they are the&nbsp;&nbsp;predominant frequencies in wake versus sleep.&nbsp; Okay. So then we'll just start straightaway with&nbsp;&nbsp;what we found with one of the overnight EEG's&nbsp; from this is a three-year-old child with SYNGAP1&nbsp;&nbsp;mutation and I'm going to focus here on the&nbsp; middle panel where we have done the power analysis&nbsp;&nbsp;for the frequency, we had the video also, we had the&nbsp; notes from the clinic. And so if you just focus on&nbsp;&nbsp;so here on the x-axis this is a 20 hour long EEG,&nbsp; including the night. So let's say it starts late&nbsp;&nbsp;in the morning and goes on to early in the morning&nbsp; the next day. Okay. So that's the x axis. On the y axis&nbsp;&nbsp;are the different stages that have been scored&nbsp; for this EEG. So here's wake. Here's non-REM. Here's REM.&nbsp;&nbsp;So this line over here as this continues is when&nbsp; the child is awake. It jumps up to non-REM when&nbsp;&nbsp;the child first falls asleep and goes into the&nbsp; first non-REM cycle. Then as we go forward over&nbsp;&nbsp;the entire time, which is quite a few hours that&nbsp; this child is asleep, you can see that the child's&nbsp;&nbsp;brain is switching between non-REM, REM, back to&nbsp; non-REM and it keeps doing that between multiple&nbsp;&nbsp;cycles until the child is awake in the morning&nbsp; and that's the wake state again. So basically this&nbsp;&nbsp;entire jump here is the time based on the EEG and&nbsp; the video and announced the child was asleep. So&nbsp;&nbsp;then overriding that all the raster plot of&nbsp; the red lines shows when this child had episodes&nbsp;&nbsp;of short duration 3 Hertz seizures. Here is&nbsp; one example from... let's see, from this one event&nbsp;&nbsp;of this high amplitude 3 Hertz spike wave discharge&nbsp; on every channel. So this is a global discharge and&nbsp;&nbsp;from the background EEG which is noisy which would&nbsp; always be noisy when the child is awake because&nbsp;&nbsp;they're not going to stay still but what you can&nbsp; see in the background is this very low amplitude/&nbsp;&nbsp;high frequency discharge which is indication that&nbsp; this child is awake. The cortex is in mostly in&nbsp;&nbsp;gamma frequency but in the middle of this gamma&nbsp; frequency this child has 3 Hertz high amplitude,&nbsp;&nbsp;short duration, 2 or 3 seconds. So that's an example&nbsp; of that event happening when the child is awake.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then here there's an expansion of a similar event&nbsp; occurring during sleep. Just on the background you&nbsp;&nbsp;can make out wake versus sleep because you have&nbsp; these high amplitude delta waves in the background&nbsp;&nbsp;but the seizure episode is exactly identical.&nbsp; It's 3 Hertz high amplitude, short duration. </p><p>So&nbsp;&nbsp;that is the predominant phenotype of&nbsp; seizures on this EEG and when we identify every&nbsp;&nbsp;episode that happened in the 24 hours you get&nbsp; these that there's an episode and as the child&nbsp;&nbsp;is coming closer to the time, even so at this&nbsp; point the technician in the room, the parent is&nbsp;&nbsp;does not know when the child is going to fall&nbsp; asleep but the brain knows when the child is, when&nbsp;&nbsp;the brain is moving towards sleep. And then you can&nbsp; see that there's an increase in the frequency of&nbsp;&nbsp;these discharges and then there's a short burst&nbsp; right when this child's brain transitions from&nbsp;&nbsp;wake to non-REM and that's here. So these are&nbsp; multiple episodes. That's why that line looks&nbsp;&nbsp;thick. Then what happens as we go through and as&nbsp; we scored them independently and just superimpose&nbsp;&nbsp;them, right when this child's brain, because now the&nbsp; child is asleep so there is no outside influence&nbsp;&nbsp;that would trigger a seizure, but inside brainwave&nbsp; states the child's brain is in non-REM, it&nbsp;&nbsp;switched to REM, that's when the brain throws a&nbsp; seizure. Then the brain is in REM and is switching&nbsp;&nbsp;to non-REM exactly at that transition point the&nbsp; brain throws a seizure. Again, another transition&nbsp;&nbsp;point there's a burst of seizures. And then again at this&nbsp; transition point there's a burst of seizures. And then when the&nbsp;&nbsp;brain knows it's going, the cortical state is&nbsp; moving from sleep to awake even before the child&nbsp;&nbsp;actually wakes up, the brain senses the strongest&nbsp; transition state and throws the highest bunch&nbsp;&nbsp;of seizures in this EEG. </p><p>So the point I'm trying to&nbsp; make is: most of these seizures are ramping up when&nbsp;&nbsp;the brain is transitioning either from wake to&nbsp; sleep or from sleep to wake and, very interestingly,&nbsp;&nbsp;even between sleep stages where there would not be&nbsp; any outside influence of light or movement or TV flash&nbsp;&nbsp;or some music. When it's transitioning from non-rem&nbsp; to REM and REM to non-REM this brain throws this&nbsp;&nbsp;3 Hertz discharge. And here I have this lowest&nbsp; panel is just an expansion of this, what we're&nbsp;&nbsp;going to call a cluster, that now as the brain, as&nbsp; the cortex realizes that this brain is going to go&nbsp;&nbsp;into a wake state, it throws a multitude of these&nbsp; shorter shots they look just looks because it's a&nbsp;&nbsp;tighter timescale but I'm just trying to show you&nbsp; where four seizures within this cluster (they are&nbsp;&nbsp;not even all the seizures happening that cluster)&nbsp; start happening repeatedly just before the child&nbsp;&nbsp;is awake. So these might happen just when the&nbsp; child is going to wake up or it might happen as&nbsp;&nbsp;soon as the child is awake which is I think what&nbsp; the previous reports from the clinicians are where&nbsp;&nbsp;there is reporting from the parents that there is&nbsp; early morning seizures, difficulty falling asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Now as the brain is transitioning, if the brain is&nbsp; seizing, there's lots of literature to figure out&nbsp;&nbsp;why then that child would not transition easily&nbsp; and might have difficulties falling asleep. But&nbsp;&nbsp;these are hypotheses at this point and&nbsp; this kind of interesting distribution is what we&nbsp;&nbsp;are trying to figure out. If we can understand&nbsp; better and then when we test novel therapies&nbsp;&nbsp;we can, in doing the same analysis, figure&nbsp; out how that is changing or not changing. Okay. So&nbsp;&nbsp;obviously the translational version of it we&nbsp; use a mouse model of SYNGAP1 and this mouse&nbsp;&nbsp;model like I said was generated in&nbsp; Rick Huganir's lab. What we are doing and what we are&nbsp;&nbsp;good at is doing these 24-hour continuous video&nbsp; EEGs with your EMG and so we have a 12 hour light&nbsp;&nbsp;and dark cycle, so making both the daytime and&nbsp; the nighttime. The technical portion is how we -&nbsp;&nbsp;this EEG signal - how we convert it here with FFT&nbsp; so that we can analyze all the frequencies within&nbsp;&nbsp;it. And then of course what was the title of a&nbsp; recently published paper is this FDA-approved&nbsp;&nbsp;drug that we tested, perampanel, which is the&nbsp; AMPA receptor antagonist. And we chose this&nbsp;&nbsp;drug because of all the literature that Rick's&nbsp; lab has already published showing that SYNGAP1&nbsp;&nbsp;at the postsynaptic membrane, having this huge&nbsp; impact of how many AMPA receptors are inserted. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;AMPA receptors are, they receive the excitatory&nbsp; signal, so if there are too little or too many&nbsp;&nbsp;very simplistically it would completely affect&nbsp; how that circuit is functioning. So just not even&nbsp;&nbsp;as a therapy, we wanted to test. This is the&nbsp; only drug available that has this specific&nbsp;&nbsp;mechanism. And since it was approved for epilepsy&nbsp; very recently we thought this was the best drug,&nbsp;&nbsp;given the data from Rick's lab, to test in this&nbsp; mouse to see if we blocked AMPA receptors what&nbsp;&nbsp;effect it would have on the EEG and especially&nbsp; on the seizures. </p><p>So first what I'm showing you is&nbsp;&nbsp;video of one such seizure that we recorded in&nbsp; a SYNGAP1 mouse and hopefully I'll be able&nbsp;&nbsp;to play it again but what this is is&nbsp; the early EEG was during sleep. The mouse threw&nbsp;&nbsp;a seizure and then it transitions to - it has some&nbsp; spikes - but it transitions to awake EEG. So I just&nbsp;&nbsp;showed you the clinical EEG and how we scored it&nbsp; and about how these seizures were happening&nbsp;&nbsp;during transitions between sleep and wake and wake and&nbsp; sleep and so here's an example of a phenotype.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I can play it again. So you can see where&nbsp; the seizure happens and these are very&nbsp;&nbsp;equidistant spikes associated with spikes on the&nbsp; EMG showing that it's an myoclonic seizure. It's a&nbsp;&nbsp;short duration seizure and the frequencies&nbsp; very surprisingly was 3 Hertz. So this is a 3&nbsp;&nbsp;Hertz seizure happening at a juncture where the&nbsp; mouse brain is transitioning from sleep to wake.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So now the \"chicken and egg question\" is: did this&nbsp; mouse brain throw seizure and that's why it woke&nbsp;up? Or did the mouse brain throw seizure because&nbsp; the brain was transitioning and whatever is&nbsp;&nbsp;the mechanism by which the cortex changes its&nbsp; sleep versus wake state that makes that brain&nbsp;&nbsp;susceptible to throw seizures? So those are&nbsp; the questions that came to our mind when we saw&nbsp;&nbsp;very consistently the Syngap mice throwing&nbsp; seizures at these transition points. And then&nbsp;&nbsp;we were excited with the phenotype because it's&nbsp; it's a 3 Hertz seizure, it's a myoclonic seizure,&nbsp;&nbsp;and that is the predominant phenotype in the&nbsp; patients. So here is the same seizure without&nbsp;&nbsp;the movement so you can focus on the leads. So the&nbsp; first lead is the EEG lead. What I'm trying to show&nbsp;&nbsp;you are the spikes that you saw when the mouse&nbsp; was seizing. On the bottom is the EMG and this&nbsp;&nbsp;is to show you that when the cortex is spiking,&nbsp; throwing a spike, the muscles on the back of this&nbsp;&nbsp;mouse, on the neck and shoulders of this mouse,&nbsp; is throwing a spike (with a slight delay). So that&nbsp;&nbsp;would be the transmission of the cortical neurons&nbsp; firing and the muscles in the back contracting. So&nbsp;&nbsp;this had a nice correlation and&nbsp; the time scale here shows that this is a 3 Hertz&nbsp;&nbsp;seizure. On the bottom is just another example of&nbsp; a seizure where there are these random spike discharges&nbsp;&nbsp;but you can see the EMG is completely silent. </p><p>So&nbsp;what does this mean? That there are seizures that&nbsp;&nbsp;you will identify in your child because there will&nbsp; be a motor component either the eyelid myoclonia that&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingrid Sheffer has described in their&nbsp; paper. So there's a motor component and if&nbsp;&nbsp;you are near your child and you're observing you&nbsp; will know that something is wrong and&nbsp;&nbsp;that there's a seizure episode. What this data&nbsp; on the bottom is trying to show you is that&nbsp;&nbsp;there can be seizure activity in the cortex of the&nbsp; mouse for sure and the EMG silent. Meaning there is&nbsp;&nbsp;no motor component and so these could be&nbsp; what we call \"electrographic only\" seizures so&nbsp;&nbsp;they would be silent seizures. So there may be a&nbsp; component where there is seizure activity where&nbsp;&nbsp;there will be no behavioral component and&nbsp; those are silent seizures which is troublesome&nbsp;&nbsp;because if there's a huge number of these the&nbsp; seizure burden on the cortex makes that cortex&nbsp;&nbsp;malfunction even more because severity of seizures&nbsp; can affect how the cortex or the brain functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So this is the quantification of the seizures we&nbsp; found in the entire study and so it's basically&nbsp;&nbsp;because we were doing it in two-month-old mice,&nbsp; which is the P60 and then the same mice when they&nbsp;&nbsp;were older (P120) and you can see that over time&nbsp; when we recorded the number of seizure events&nbsp;&nbsp;went up and the circle here denotes the&nbsp; myoclonic seizures. So the younger mice had the&nbsp;&nbsp;specific just single phenotype but as they got&nbsp; older they started showing multiple different&nbsp;&nbsp;phenotypes. Okay. So this is what we would call&nbsp; progression in the mouse model. And this&nbsp;&nbsp;pie chart here is showing you that most of the&nbsp; seizures were starting in non-REM. And this is very&nbsp;&nbsp;very well known in both in epilepsy patients and&nbsp; in development disorders associated with seizures&nbsp;&nbsp;that there's something about the non-REM state&nbsp; with the slow oscillation Delta wave that makes&nbsp;&nbsp;the brain most susceptible to throw a seizure. So&nbsp; that was the phenotype in the young mouse where&nbsp;&nbsp;most of the seizures were arising from sleep and&nbsp; then as the mouse got older you can see that that&nbsp;&nbsp;frequency changed. Most of them were then happening&nbsp; during the wake state. So all this is saying is&nbsp;&nbsp;for the model that the phenotype is changing over&nbsp; time. And we know this to be true in developmental&nbsp;&nbsp;disorders that the epilepsy is not static. It&nbsp; sometimes progresses, sometimes it regresses and&nbsp;&nbsp;then sometimes the type of seizures change. So&nbsp; this is interesting for the mouse model&nbsp;&nbsp;because then now we are having multiple seizure&nbsp; types and if we do interventions we can see the&nbsp;&nbsp;effect of multiple interventions on those various&nbsp; phenotypes. So this is all good for the modeling&nbsp;&nbsp;world. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Dr. Kadam, I'm sorry to interrupt you&nbsp; but if we could just go back to slide eight for&nbsp;&nbsp;a second. For those of us who don't&nbsp; spend a lot of time thinking about mouse models&nbsp;&nbsp;would you mind just elaborating on what P60 and&nbsp; P120 mean and how those how those ages translate&nbsp;&nbsp;to kid ages because this is clearly... </p><p>Dr Kadam: That's a very&nbsp; important question. And I was definitely going to&nbsp;&nbsp;touch on that because Brennan is on this call and he's working on, and we are working&nbsp;&nbsp;on, doing much younger ages because of course&nbsp; this is a developmental disorder. So this was&nbsp;&nbsp;a pilot study. A P60 means 60 days old. So that's a&nbsp; two month old mouse. So that's a young mouse. So&nbsp;&nbsp;mice are weaned from their moms or \"dams\" at around&nbsp; P21 right. So that would be the time when when they&nbsp;&nbsp;can fend for themselves. So P60 is a young mouse. &nbsp; It is definitely not a child though. And P120 is&nbsp;&nbsp;just a older mouse and here the significance is&nbsp; because then we're trying to record from the same&nbsp;&nbsp;mouse to look at progression. So as a pilot study&nbsp; and coming from the epilepsy research field there&nbsp;&nbsp;is a very important caveat where even if you&nbsp; look at other papers where people have studied&nbsp;&nbsp;Rett syndrome, CDKL5, you will see that they're&nbsp; using adult mice. And more and more as we have&nbsp;&nbsp;these grants for review and reviewing grants,&nbsp; NIH and the reviewers are like \"these disorders are&nbsp;&nbsp;developmental so you need to start looking at much&nbsp; younger ages\". Luckily that is the bread and butter&nbsp;&nbsp;of our lab. We study neonatal seizures&nbsp; in pups but because this was our first&nbsp;&nbsp;initial foray into SYNGAP1 and nobody&nbsp; had quantified how the epilepsy... what was all&nbsp;&nbsp;the phenotypes possible in this model and how it&nbsp; was progressing over age. We needed&nbsp;&nbsp;this infrastructure to start then going uniquely.&nbsp; Because neonatal EEG is tricky and I will talk about&nbsp;&nbsp;that as because those are the experiments we are&nbsp; doing right now. So hopefully that has addressed the&nbsp;&nbsp;question but I will touch on this again when we&nbsp; start talking about what we are doing currently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So that the ages we are doing right now will be&nbsp; covering the age even from a newborn to the first&nbsp;&nbsp;two years of life where we will want to figure out&nbsp; what is happening in the same mouse at early ages&nbsp;&nbsp;and can we do interventions that would then change&nbsp; the trajectory? But now we know what the trajectory&nbsp;&nbsp;is. So if we did some intervention in the pups&nbsp; and then we did a P60 again and lo and behold&nbsp;&nbsp;they had no seizures, then we we could convince&nbsp; the NIH or pharma that look, our intervention is&nbsp;&nbsp;changing the progression of this disease. At least&nbsp; for the epilepsy. And then when we talk about the&nbsp;&nbsp;gamma oscillations which totally underlie&nbsp; cognition that we are actually trying, we are&nbsp;&nbsp;improving cognition in the mouse. </p><p>So this data is&nbsp; critically important because in translational&nbsp;&nbsp;research we need this end point to&nbsp; show data that would have NIH's confidence or a&nbsp;&nbsp;small big pharma's confidence that we are actually&nbsp; by some intervention, novel or, like perampanel,&nbsp;&nbsp;that's already approved, we are able to change&nbsp; the trajectory of the disease. Because developmental&nbsp;&nbsp;disorders have that, that in an immature brain&nbsp; having seizures there's lots of&nbsp;&nbsp;literature to show the seizures themselves affect&nbsp; how that brain matures. And so it's difficult to&nbsp;&nbsp;parse out how much are the seizures by themselves&nbsp; contributing to the cognitive dysfunction versus&nbsp;&nbsp;the underlying genetic cause that may be&nbsp; contributing to cognitive dysfunction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So \"part and parcel\" of seizures are interictal&nbsp; spikes. Interictal means between two seizures. So&nbsp;&nbsp;any kind of spike activity that is now identified&nbsp; by these red asterisks here is called interictal&nbsp;&nbsp;because now we know that this mouse&nbsp; seizes and so interictal spikes by themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;are a huge area of focus and research for being&nbsp; able to predict when a seizure is going to happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;So usually normal EEGs will not have these spikes.&nbsp; Or at least not at this frequency. So what this&nbsp;&nbsp;very simplistically indicates is that this brain is&nbsp; hyper excitable. There are times when the person&nbsp;&nbsp;or the mouse is just normally functioning that&nbsp; a bunch of neurons just throw a massive spike&nbsp;&nbsp;together. So this does not happen in a normal brain.&nbsp; This is just an example of spikes happening during&nbsp;&nbsp;wake and spikes happening during non-REM which is&nbsp; the sleep state we just discussed. Here again is&nbsp;&nbsp;the background EEG showing you wake. It's small&nbsp; amplitude higher frequency. Here's the background&nbsp;&nbsp;showing you high amplitude, slower frequency.&nbsp; The spikes almost look identical but what&nbsp;&nbsp;this example shows you that in general we found&nbsp; there were more spikes during non-REM then during&nbsp;&nbsp;make states. This again ties and is very common in&nbsp; epileptic brains where seizures and spikes happen&nbsp;&nbsp;during sleep states and that that circuit state&nbsp; is more conducive for seizures to appear. </p><p>So here&nbsp;&nbsp;Brennan went and quantified every spike in the&nbsp; 24-hour EEG. So this is a lot of work and it shows:&nbsp;&nbsp;so the wild-type is the mouse that does not&nbsp; have the mutation and then the P60 and P120&nbsp;&nbsp;like we discussed is the mutant mouse at 2 months&nbsp; old and then the same mouse older. And you can see&nbsp;&nbsp;a natural progression in the incidence of these&nbsp; spikes but you can see it as the color code is&nbsp;&nbsp;wake versus sleep that most of these spikes and&nbsp; significantly are occurring during sleep. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;we also know that, you know, the light phase&nbsp; has an effect on spike and sleep generation.&nbsp;&nbsp;So because mice have diurnal cycle in addition to the&nbsp; circadian cycle, when they sleep during when the&nbsp;&nbsp;lights are on versus when the lights are off. Why&nbsp; is this important? Because unlike us rodents are&nbsp;&nbsp;nocturnal. So basically they're sleeping during the&nbsp; light and they're exploring, eating, grooming during&nbsp;&nbsp;the dark. And as you can see, most of these spikes&nbsp; when we parse the same data into whether it was&nbsp;&nbsp;during the light sleep cycle or the dark sleep&nbsp; cycle, most of them are occurring during light&nbsp;&nbsp;sleep. So this is when the rodents are&nbsp; sleeping. So this would mean like a child during&nbsp;&nbsp;the night if we were trying to make a&nbsp; human comparison. And then as we have already seen&nbsp;&nbsp;before when you look at the sleep stage within&nbsp; light sleep or dark sleep, spikes are driven by&nbsp;&nbsp;non-REM, without a doubt. This is not very unique&nbsp; because Rett syndrome kids will show&nbsp;&nbsp;the same thing. Most developmental disorders that&nbsp; have epilepsy this matches the profile that non-REM&nbsp;&nbsp;states make the brain more vulnerable for&nbsp; throwing spikes and seizures. And over here so&nbsp;&nbsp;this bar on the top is showing you the start of&nbsp; the EEG and end of the EEG but the light cycle&nbsp;&nbsp;on. So here the lights are off. Lights are on.&nbsp; Lights are off. So this the black portion adds&nbsp;&nbsp;up to 12 hours. The white portion adds up to 12&nbsp; hours. And so here's the 0 to 24 hour indicating&nbsp;&nbsp;the duration of the EEG. This is the frequency plot&nbsp; for the number of spikes and you can see how they&nbsp;&nbsp;go up and down at P60. </p><p>So this is a younger mouse&nbsp; and then the same mice a little bit older. So in&nbsp;&nbsp;general you can see the frequency of spikes are&nbsp; going up but when the seizures happen, which are&nbsp;&nbsp;these red lines, when the seizures happened&nbsp; in the younger mouse there does not seem to be a&nbsp;&nbsp;direct correlation between when the spikes were&nbsp; happening and when the seizures because there&nbsp;&nbsp;seems to be a continuous occurrence of spikes. But&nbsp; then when you look at P120 you can clearly&nbsp;&nbsp;see what we have seen here with a non-REM and in&nbsp; the light cycle, there's a little bump during the&nbsp;&nbsp;light cycle which is this white bar here. So&nbsp; frequency of spikes is going up during their&nbsp;&nbsp;sleep during the light cycle and the seizures start&nbsp; occurring when this transition is happening. So as&nbsp;&nbsp;the spikes are going up the seizures are going up.&nbsp; So what all that could mean at this point is that&nbsp;&nbsp;susceptibility for spikes and seizures starts&nbsp; going up at that time point in the light sleep&nbsp;&nbsp;during non-REM. And this is just interesting to&nbsp; keep tabs on because as we start analyzing more&nbsp;&nbsp;of the EEGs coming from the kids with Syngap&nbsp; we will want to see whether this holds&nbsp;&nbsp;true for the kids too. And this has tremendous&nbsp; relevance for when an anti-seizure drug is given&nbsp;&nbsp;to the child. So let's say, just a very&nbsp; simple example, if this is a 24-hour cycle and&nbsp;&nbsp;obviously you're not going to wake up your child&nbsp; and give them medication. Well that's not usually&nbsp;&nbsp;the protocol. But if the seizures are happening at&nbsp; that time and you give your medication here versus&nbsp;&nbsp;here it's very easy to hypothesize that this dose&nbsp; given here maybe would be the early morning for&nbsp;&nbsp;the child will not be efficacious versus if you&nbsp; gave it here maybe it would stop all of these&nbsp;&nbsp;seizures. So I just want you to keep that in mind&nbsp; on if the seizures are occurring at a particular&nbsp;&nbsp;time of day but the dose and then the highest&nbsp; concentration of the dose in the body is at a&nbsp;&nbsp;different time of day that would for the same dose&nbsp; have completely different efficacies in the same&nbsp;&nbsp;child. </p><p>Okay so this is a hypnogram from a mouse. So this is what I mean by the...&nbsp;&nbsp;so here's, this is 24 hours, this is the light&nbsp; cycle. Here's dark and then the light. So daytime.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nighttime. Daytime. 12 hours each. And the same thing&nbsp; as we showed before. So the yellow is all the&nbsp;&nbsp;time that this mouse is awake. The blue is when&nbsp; the mouse is in non-REM and the red is when the&nbsp;&nbsp;mouse is in REM. So that's wake, non-REM, REM. So you&nbsp; can clearly see obviously there are differences&nbsp;&nbsp;between a mouse hypnogram and a human&nbsp; hypnogram but the stages are similar. The transitions&nbsp;&nbsp;are similar and when I said ultradian is that&nbsp; you see that because this is a light cycle that's&nbsp;&nbsp;when the mouse is sleeping and hiding away from&nbsp; predators there are many more sleep cycles. During&nbsp;&nbsp;the dark cycle when they are very active exploring,&nbsp; feeding, grooming, they're awake for most of the time&nbsp;&nbsp;but there are sleep cycles during&nbsp; the dark phase and then it moves again to the&nbsp;&nbsp;light phase. So basically you are now familiar with&nbsp; the three stages: wake, non-Rapid Eye Movement (non-&nbsp;&nbsp;REM) and then REM. I already said this, the mice are&nbsp; nocturnal and so they have the ultradian each&nbsp;&nbsp;sleep cycle. So hopefully now you understand what&nbsp; the difference is between a mouse hypnogram and a&nbsp;&nbsp;human hypnogram. So when we looked at these mice&nbsp; and their sleep cycles because sleep is a huge&nbsp;&nbsp;problem in many development disorders including&nbsp; SYNGAP1 here is a wild-type hypnogram. Here's&nbsp;&nbsp;the one of the younger the two-month-old Syngap&nbsp; mouse and then the same mice when they got older.&nbsp;&nbsp;And just eyeballing it if you see the same mouse&nbsp; at P60 versus P120 you can see the difference&nbsp;&nbsp;in how this mouse is now cycling. And when we&nbsp; quantified that, because mice are nocturnal and&nbsp;&nbsp;that is critical to their survival, if they start&nbsp; being active during the day and sleeping&nbsp;&nbsp;most of the time when they're supposed to be&nbsp; exploring and feeding you can see how that could&nbsp;&nbsp;be detrimental but when you quantify that you can&nbsp; see the wild-type there's a clear distinction of how&nbsp;&nbsp;much percent of the time they're in wake or sleep.&nbsp; At P60 this difference goes away a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp;but it's still significant. </p><p>At P120 this mouse&nbsp; has completely lost its nocturnal predominance&nbsp;&nbsp;of how it does its activities and that the same&nbsp; version, this is the same data quantified in a&nbsp;&nbsp;different way. So basically you can see for light&nbsp; and dark, red versus the blue, the wild-type, as&nbsp;&nbsp;you would expect a normal mouse, has a significant&nbsp; difference on how it cycles through in the light&nbsp;&nbsp;and dark cycle. And the P60, P120 this&nbsp; is lost to a greater extent. So this of course&nbsp;&nbsp;we have to see in the light of a mouse how this&nbsp; would be detrimental for the mouse's survival and&nbsp;&nbsp;well-being. So the take-home message from here is&nbsp; that the sleep cycles are completely disrupted&nbsp;&nbsp;in the Syngap mouse compared to their wild-type&nbsp; counterparts. And then here we have, this&nbsp;&nbsp;trace, you know, when the mouse is in the cage the&nbsp; video is on there's software where you can trace&nbsp;&nbsp;all the movements the mouse does&nbsp; during the 24-hour cycle. So this is qualification&nbsp;&nbsp;of once a wild-type and a Syngap mouse. Here's wild-type. Here's P120. And the software keeps&nbsp;&nbsp;tracing how the mouse moves. So you can see that&nbsp; during the day, during the 24-hour cycle the&nbsp;&nbsp;wild-type has this amount of movement. You can see&nbsp; a hotspot here which I would predict would either&nbsp;&nbsp;be where the waterspout is or where the food was.&nbsp; But look at the same so both this wild-type that is at&nbsp;&nbsp;P120 and look at the Syngap mouse. This tremendous&nbsp; hyperactivity. The hotspot is in the center here&nbsp;&nbsp;which would almost mean it's not associated with&nbsp; with where the food was or where the waterspout&nbsp;&nbsp;was. So it's just overall hyperactivity. And when&nbsp; you quantify that based on the light cycle where&nbsp;&nbsp;here's the the period when it's dark and this is&nbsp; normal so the if you follow the black line which&nbsp;&nbsp;is a control which the normal mouse does and&nbsp; so they are very little active during the day&nbsp;&nbsp;and when they are nocturnal their activity goes&nbsp; up and this is when they do all their movements,&nbsp;&nbsp;all their nesting, grooming stuff and then when&nbsp; the light comes on it goes down again. And then&nbsp;&nbsp;in the dotted line is the younger Syngap mouse&nbsp; and the solid red red line is the older Syngap mouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;And you can see there's some hyperactivity even during the cycle but during the night this activity is very&nbsp;&nbsp;significantly high and almost when the lights come&nbsp; on at the older ages they don't even stop. They&nbsp;&nbsp;keep going before it comes down. </p><p>So the take-home&nbsp; message here is that these mice replicate some of&nbsp;&nbsp;the phenotypes in the Syngap Syndrome where&nbsp; there's tremendous hyperactivity. Now I mean we&nbsp;&nbsp;will be doing additional tests to see whether this&nbsp; activity is directed or just not related&nbsp;&nbsp;to any task and here is the quantification for&nbsp; the things showing you the significant increase&nbsp;&nbsp;in hyperactivity in the Syngap mouse. Both at P60 there's&nbsp; a trend and then becomes very hyperactive at P120.&nbsp;&nbsp;So then we move. Now we transition. So now we&nbsp; know this mouse has seizures. We are excited that&nbsp;&nbsp;it has a phenotype of seizures that is actually&nbsp; seen in the patients. We are excited to know that&nbsp;&nbsp;they're happening at the transition points that&nbsp; our early human EEG studies are showing that&nbsp;&nbsp;they're occurring at transitions between wake and&nbsp; sleep and non-REM and REM. So like I said there's&nbsp;&nbsp;a huge area research of great researchers who&nbsp; are looking at gamma oscillations in the cortex&nbsp;&nbsp;because it underlies cognitive ability. If you are&nbsp; focused on a task your gamma oscillations in the&nbsp;&nbsp;cortex go up. Even if you're awake and you are not,&nbsp; you know, you're in a resting stage you're gamma&nbsp;&nbsp;oscillations will go down. So there's a very tight&nbsp; correlation of task engagement, cognition, learning&nbsp;&nbsp;and gamma oscillations in the cortex. Like I&nbsp; showed you before it's a 30 to 100 Hertz in&nbsp;&nbsp;mice because using protocols from our&nbsp; previous research we are looking at this 30 to 100&nbsp;&nbsp;Hertz kind of gamma rhythm and then there's lots&nbsp; of literature to show that gamma oscillations are&nbsp;&nbsp;driven by interneurons. Now inter neurons are&nbsp; the neurons that are the \"no-go\" signal in&nbsp;&nbsp;the brain. So there's excitatory neurons which are&nbsp; the \"go\" signal and the interneurons that are the&nbsp;&nbsp;\"no-go\" signal meaning you stop the neurons from&nbsp; firing. And one class of these neurons is known&nbsp;&nbsp;as parvalbumin (PV). You will see this&nbsp; PV in all the next slides but it stands for&nbsp;parvalbumin interneurons and there's lots of&nbsp; literature to show that these interneurons they&nbsp;&nbsp;drive gamma oscillations in the cortex. So here's&nbsp; a simple schematic and I'll go through this again&nbsp;&nbsp;later on. </p><p>So what I just said that there are&nbsp; excitatory neurons meaning the ones that fire&nbsp;&nbsp;signals for us to do an activity if it's motor or&nbsp; to start a start a rhythm for certain functions&nbsp;&nbsp;in the brain and those are represented by these&nbsp; blue triangles. So the PYR is pyramidal neurons&nbsp;&nbsp;these are excitatory and they are in the cortex&nbsp; in huge numbers. Parvalbumin neurons it says GABA&nbsp;&nbsp;because that's the ligand that's released by these inter-&nbsp;&nbsp;neurons onto the excitatory neurons that gives them&nbsp; the \"no-go\" signal. So when this neuron is firing, if&nbsp;a parvalbumin positive neuron fires onto&nbsp; it (and that's why it's a \"no-go\") it will stop&nbsp;&nbsp;this excitatory neuron from firing. So that's&nbsp; very simple. Excitatory: go. Inhibitory: no-go. The red&nbsp;&nbsp;ones are the interneurons the blue ones are the&nbsp; excitatory neurons. But to make this slightly more&nbsp;&nbsp;complex, these interneurons are connected to each&nbsp; other with electrical synapses meaning they can&nbsp;&nbsp;then now fire together much faster instead of them&nbsp; communicating to one another but they also inhibit&nbsp;&nbsp;one another. So this is a very interesting&nbsp; circuit and this subgroup of interneurons&nbsp;&nbsp;is very critical in the cortex and we will go over&nbsp; this a little bit later. So for now right now&nbsp;&nbsp;what we're looking at is the \"go\" signal neurons,&nbsp; the \"no-go\" red neurons, they inhibit the excitatory&nbsp;&nbsp;neurons and they talk to each other. They inhibit&nbsp; each other and they also talk to one another. So&nbsp;&nbsp;that is the circuit in the cortex that many people&nbsp; have focused on because they underlie these gamma&nbsp;&nbsp;oscillations in the brain. So these PV interneurons are also called as fast-spiking interneurons&nbsp;&nbsp;and I pull this slide just so that people&nbsp; who have not seen firing patterns of these \"no-go\"&nbsp;&nbsp;signals can understand why this is a special class&nbsp; of interneuron. So here is patch clamp onto an&nbsp;&nbsp;interneuron and this B graph is showing you&nbsp; the single firing pattern of fast-spiking&nbsp;&nbsp;interneuron, which is our PV interneuron, a non-fast&nbsp; spiking interneuron, which are the other types&nbsp;&nbsp;of interneurons and a pyramidal neuron which was&nbsp; the blue neuron in a previous slide. So here's&nbsp;&nbsp;a fast-spiking. So this, if you take anything&nbsp; from this slide, is PV interneurons have a very&nbsp;&nbsp;high frequency firing way. What that means for&nbsp; electrical properties and how this neuron is built&nbsp;&nbsp;and is all interesting research that's ongoing&nbsp; and then you can see a non fast-spiking&nbsp;&nbsp;when it goes fast and then it peters out. And your&nbsp; neuron is a much slower firing pattern so very&nbsp;&nbsp;simplistically it would be if this blue neuron,&nbsp; which is an interneuron, has to stop this neuron from&nbsp;&nbsp;firing you would expect that it would have to fire&nbsp; it a much faster rate then the excitatory neuron.&nbsp;&nbsp;So this neuron would fire at this rate and stop&nbsp; this neuron from firing. And then the other (if&nbsp;&nbsp;I can go back a slide) the other characteristic of&nbsp; the specific parvalbumin interneurons is that&nbsp;&nbsp;they inhibit the neurons right on the cell body.&nbsp; It's like before the horse gets out of the stable&nbsp;&nbsp;it's a \"no-go\" signal. So it's a circuit&nbsp; which controls very tightly the firing pattern of&nbsp;&nbsp;the excitatory neurons. Other interneurons are&nbsp; known to form synapses on the branches of the parvalbumin neurons.&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is a very specific characteristic of a fast- spiking interneuron. And then we just talked about&nbsp;&nbsp;the firing pattern. So this is just to show you&nbsp; that these interneurons have the ability&nbsp;&nbsp;to spike at very fast frequencies compared&nbsp; to the excitatory neuron and other interneurons.&nbsp;&nbsp;So now this is the same data that we saw for the&nbsp; hypnogram before and we have color-coded it for&nbsp;&nbsp;the gamma power on the EEG for the mice. Okay. So&nbsp; the color code is still the same. We have taken&nbsp;&nbsp;out REM because in the mice they're very short&nbsp; duration. So basically this with the same color&nbsp;&nbsp;code this yellow color is the wake. Blue is the&nbsp; non-REM but instead of seeing the hypnogram&nbsp;&nbsp;now you're seeing every dot here is the 10-second&nbsp; EEG power for gamma frequency. Just for the gamma&nbsp;&nbsp;frequency. </p><p>Okay. So here's again the&nbsp; bar on top for the 24 hours. This is switched&nbsp;&nbsp;around for the way in which the data is&nbsp; shown. So it starts in the night. Here's the entire&nbsp;&nbsp;12 hours of light and then here's the remaining 6&nbsp; hours of dark. So what you can see in the wild-type,&nbsp;&nbsp;you can see this mouse is going through wake&nbsp; cycle, sleep cycles, wake cycles, sleep&nbsp;&nbsp;cycles but what is happening to the gamma power&nbsp; when the mouse is waking up and sleeping? As&nbsp;&nbsp;soon as the mouse wakes up the gamma power goes&nbsp; up. As soon as the mouse sleeps the gamma power&nbsp;&nbsp;starts falling. Okay. So this makes sense for&nbsp; the simplistic thing I said that when you are&nbsp;&nbsp;awake and active and doing something or reading&nbsp; something the gamma oscillations in your cortex&nbsp;&nbsp;will go up. When you sleep and as the delta&nbsp; slow waves start coming in, gamma power comes down.&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is a way how the brain adjusts and it's&nbsp; known that this is very critical for&nbsp;&nbsp;learning. So whenever the gamma power goes up and&nbsp; your're awake and you are learning a new thing, you're&nbsp;&nbsp;reading something new, it is very critical that&nbsp; your gamma power drops during sleep so that the&nbsp;&nbsp;brain can then put that what you've learnt or what&nbsp; you've read into your long-term memory. So that you&nbsp;&nbsp;remember it the next morning. Or with multiple&nbsp; readings in a few days. So that's how the brain&nbsp;&nbsp;learns or this is one of the components that's&nbsp; been proposed underlying learning and memory. So&nbsp;&nbsp;consistently, and this is just an expanded version&nbsp; of the data in this red box, here the mouse&nbsp;&nbsp;is awake. As soon as he falls asleep his gamma&nbsp; starts dropping. Even before the mouse is going&nbsp;&nbsp;to wake up, just as the child will wake up, the&nbsp; gamma starts going up. Okay. And you see that&nbsp;&nbsp;consistently. So you see the gamma oscillating up&nbsp; and down, up and down, during sleep. What happens in&nbsp;&nbsp;the Syngap mouse? So here is an example of the same&nbsp; analysis from the EEG of a Syngap mouse and you&nbsp;&nbsp;can see it's color-coded for sleep states but we&nbsp; don't- the oscillations become very muted and in&nbsp;&nbsp;fact if you watch closely here and here... here is&nbsp; the gamma during wake and it's actually jumping&nbsp;&nbsp;up during sleep. So it's the relationship of what&nbsp; gamma should be doing in the cortex is not only gone&nbsp;&nbsp;away but in certain cycles it's actually switching.&nbsp; So here you can see here's the gamma. It goes up&nbsp;&nbsp;during when this mouse falls asleep and actually&nbsp; goes down when it's awake and then in one cycle&nbsp;&nbsp;it actually goes up and so the relationship of&nbsp; the up and down that is so tightly controlled by&nbsp;&nbsp;the cortex is lost and that's what's shown here. So&nbsp; and in this cycle actually we're actually showing&nbsp;&nbsp;the gamma has gone out. So something has completely&nbsp; switched where the relationship of wake and sleep&nbsp;&nbsp;gamma oscillations, the high-frequency oscillations,&nbsp; is not only lost, it has reversed in certain cycles.&nbsp;&nbsp;And then we gave, like I said PMP stands&nbsp; for perampanel which is the AMPA receptor antagonist.&nbsp;&nbsp;So this was our first pilot study and and we&nbsp; gave a low dose which is 2 milligrams per kilogram&nbsp;&nbsp;and we just gave two doses. So this is acute&nbsp; dosing. Not long-term dosing to this mouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the same mouse, this P120 mouse, when he&nbsp; got perampanel, it seemed like it started transitioning&nbsp;&nbsp;again normally. So here you can see this gamma&nbsp; and instead of going up in the same mouse it's&nbsp;&nbsp;actually going down. So now gamma oscillations&nbsp; have returned and that's why we call this as&nbsp;&nbsp;perampanel-mediated rescue of the sleep/wake gamma&nbsp; transition. </p><p>We were very excited to see this&nbsp;&nbsp;because now this is hypothesis driven right. We hypothesized that since Rick's lab has&nbsp;&nbsp;shown that AMPA receptor insertion is one of the&nbsp; critical functions of SYNGAP1 at the synapse&nbsp;&nbsp;that when it's not working and if there&nbsp; are excessive AMPA receptors what could happen&nbsp;&nbsp;to this transition and now if you give a drug at&nbsp; a low dose that blocks those AMPA receptors then&nbsp;&nbsp;the cortex now starts oscillating. Just like in&nbsp; control. So then we went in. We went and quantified&nbsp;&nbsp;this. So this is basically the wild-type like I&nbsp; said the dotted line is form wake to non-REM which&nbsp;&nbsp;would be that the gamma oscillations&nbsp; are dropping and the solid line is from non-REM to&nbsp;&nbsp;wake is when the gamma should be going up and&nbsp; so you can see here on an from the negative&nbsp;&nbsp;scale towards the positive scale and that's zero&nbsp; line as you would expect all the way to non-REM&nbsp;&nbsp;which is the dotted line or in the negative which&nbsp; means the gamma, you know, gamma power is falling&nbsp;&nbsp;these are slopes of the transition and then from&nbsp; non-REM to wake, when the cortex is getting engaged&nbsp;&nbsp;in gamma is going up, in the wild-type you can&nbsp; see all of those slopes are in the positive&nbsp;&nbsp;side and those two transitions non-REM to wake,&nbsp; are significantly as expected different from each&nbsp;&nbsp;other. What happens in Syngap this difference&nbsp; is completely lost and so that significance goes&nbsp;&nbsp;away. So whether it's one transition or the other,&nbsp; the brain cortex does not seem to be recognizing&nbsp;&nbsp;that it needs to switch to higher or lower gamma.&nbsp; When we gave perampanel, acutely, the same mouse&nbsp;&nbsp;we brought it back to quasi, very significantly&nbsp; back to control. So what we can take away from this&nbsp;&nbsp;data is the AMPA receptors seem to be playing&nbsp; a huge role in these transitions and that a drug&nbsp;&nbsp;that blocks those receptors can acutely switch it&nbsp; back to normal. Okay. And this is a very low dose, two&nbsp;&nbsp;milligrams is a low dose of perampanel. </p><p>Okay. What&nbsp; are we doing for time? Oh my god I almost&nbsp;&nbsp;took up the whole hour. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;No, this is amazing please&nbsp; keep going. </p><p>Dr Kadam:&nbsp;Okay. So then of course I showed you&nbsp;&nbsp;the first Syngap child's EEG and we saw&nbsp; seizures even happening between non-REM and REM.&nbsp;&nbsp;So we wanted to look at those transitions. So we&nbsp; looked at from the yellow to the blue and the blue&nbsp;&nbsp;to the yellow. Now we will look at from the blue to&nbsp; the red and from the red back to the blue which is&nbsp;&nbsp;this and these are the heat spectrograms off the&nbsp; EEG and I just want you to just focus on this is&nbsp;&nbsp;non-REM to REM transition (this is in a wild-type)&nbsp; and if you just eyeball it you can see that even&nbsp;&nbsp;with a few second transition, the heat map&nbsp; off that EEG is changing. Indicating now the&nbsp;&nbsp;brain is transition from non-REM to REM. This is&nbsp; from a Syngap mouse and that transition now&nbsp;&nbsp;is not that self-evident. It's kind of blurred and&nbsp; when you quantitate that by power and I'm going to&nbsp;&nbsp;make this a little bit shorter by focusing on&nbsp; here for the gamma because we've been talking&nbsp;&nbsp;about gamma. The gray and the dark grey are the&nbsp; Syngap mice and and this transition is very&nbsp;&nbsp;weak compared to the wild type mouse and we give&nbsp; perampanel (the blue) it kind of brings it back and&nbsp;&nbsp;looks like the control. So these transition states&nbsp; by perampanel are being rescued both from sleep&nbsp;&nbsp;to wake and in during sleep from non-REM to REM.&nbsp; And that's what we've done. We've given a low dose&nbsp;&nbsp;perampanel. We've not done anything else and these are&nbsp; adult mice. </p><p>Okay, so that is what I wanted to focus&nbsp;&nbsp;on and we already talked about that. The other&nbsp; thing we did was we did because I just explained&nbsp;&nbsp;the importance of these PV interneurons and we&nbsp; know their role in gamma oscillations and when&nbsp;&nbsp;we had this finding but then beside we have the&nbsp; brains from these mice and that's why we you know&nbsp;&nbsp;we can take the sections, we can stain them&nbsp; and we should look at PV interneurons because&nbsp;&nbsp;there's lots of literature to show that PV interneuron or &nbsp; the dysfunction, drives gamma oscillation dysfunction. So we&nbsp;&nbsp;stained four PV interneurons which are in this fluorescent&nbsp; green that's PV. GluA2 which is a AMPA&nbsp;&nbsp;receptor subunit and then the blue which is just&nbsp; a nuclear stains with every cell will show up all&nbsp;&nbsp;the blue dots are all the neurons. The ones with a&nbsp; blue dot and the green are the interneurons and&nbsp;&nbsp;you can see they are far and few. So the very basic&nbsp; ratio of interneurons to neurons in the cortex&nbsp;&nbsp;is 1:10. So for every 10 excitatory neurons&nbsp; there's one interneuron and that's all the inter-&nbsp;&nbsp;neurons and then there's a subclass of those that&nbsp; are PV positive. So this is just a binary image of&nbsp;&nbsp;that on how we quantitate it and all these little&nbsp;puncta are the synapses that&nbsp;&nbsp;these PV interneurons are making on all these&nbsp; other blue cells. So if you just eyeball it you&nbsp;&nbsp;can see there's a significant difference between&nbsp; the wild-type and the Syngap mouse and so there&nbsp;&nbsp;seems to be a huge reduction in how these&nbsp; interneurons are branching, which we quantified here&nbsp;&nbsp;and you can see the PV counts which are the puncta,&nbsp; was significantly lower and the number of cells&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves was slightly lower. For the GluA2 we&nbsp; did not see any significant differences in the&nbsp;&nbsp;sense of how many GluA2 AMPA receptors were&nbsp; on these PV interneurons. </p><p>Okay. But when we looked&nbsp;&nbsp;in the barrel cortex, so the somatosensory&nbsp; cortex, we saw a completely different picture. Again&nbsp;&nbsp;the color coordination is exactly the same:&nbsp; the green on the PV interneurons, the GluA2&nbsp;&nbsp;is the red, and because it's such a small signal&nbsp; here is a magnification and the arrows are&nbsp;&nbsp;showing you one specific interneuron (PV) and the&nbsp; expansion is showing you that same PV interneuron&nbsp;&nbsp;how much AMPA receptors it has on its soma which&nbsp; is the body of the neuron and this is a wild-type&nbsp;&nbsp;it has some, which we expect, but look at the SYNGAP1.&nbsp; It has significantly higher GluA2 AMPA&nbsp;&nbsp;receptors on the body of the interneuron, both&nbsp; in these are layers of the cortex two&nbsp;&nbsp;three and five six and this is iso cortical&nbsp; meaning similar to human cortex and so we saw&nbsp;&nbsp;this significant increase in GluA2. Now we gave&nbsp; pure perampanel which is a drug which would block&nbsp;&nbsp;these receptors and so the connection there&nbsp; is PV interneurons we know have a huge role&nbsp;&nbsp;to play in gamma oscillations and when we look&nbsp; at the somatosensory cortex of these mice they&nbsp;&nbsp;have this significant increase of AMPA receptor&nbsp; expression on their soma. So this is what I just&nbsp;&nbsp;said. GluA2 is generally expressed at very low&nbsp; levels and in GABAergic interneurons and there's&nbsp;&nbsp;previous work from other researchers and this&nbsp; this group is in Germany, where they artificially&nbsp;&nbsp;using genetic techniques did this right. It was&nbsp; not a Syngap mouse. They took a mouse and&nbsp;&nbsp;with genetic techniques did this to the mouse:&nbsp; increased AMPA receptors was on to GABAergic&nbsp;&nbsp;neurons. What happened when they did this the,&nbsp; GAD-GluA2 mouse, it significantly disrupted&nbsp;&nbsp;the gamma oscillation. So here is a mouse&nbsp; that they just increased the GluA2 on&nbsp;&nbsp;these GAD positive which is GABAergic neurons and&nbsp; it completely disrupted the gamma oscillation. So&nbsp;&nbsp;we are naturally finding this in our Syngap mouse&nbsp; but when somebody else did this using genetic&nbsp;&nbsp;techniques it resulted in the same disruption. So we&nbsp; were very excited when we came across this paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ok so this is basically what I've been telling&nbsp; you guys about, what Rick's lab has contributed,&nbsp;&nbsp;which is a significant contribution and&nbsp; this is Yoichi's work showing very elegantly&nbsp;&nbsp;advanced and so this is a normal postsynaptic&nbsp; spine here are the AMPA receptors in red these&nbsp;&nbsp;little two things and there's a very very well&nbsp; control cycle of how many receptors are at the&nbsp;&nbsp;synapse, how they cycle, how they take it out of&nbsp; circulation and how they re inserted. Ok. So now&nbsp;&nbsp;SynGAP sits in this postsynaptic density and&nbsp; when it is not functioning which is this greyed out&nbsp;&nbsp;in this cycling gets disrupted and&nbsp; then there's no control and more and more AMPA&nbsp;&nbsp;receptors start getting inserted. Which is kind&nbsp; of- when I showed you the thing&nbsp;&nbsp;is this is what we predict is happening. So this&nbsp; mouse has no SynGAP in the postsynaptic and for&nbsp;&nbsp;some reason, specifically for these interneurons,&nbsp; more and more AMPA receptors get inserted onto&nbsp;&nbsp;the synapses in this cortex. So this had the&nbsp; data that Rick's lab has shown matches what&nbsp;&nbsp;we are seeing but specifically for interneurons.&nbsp; So coming back to the circuit that you have seen&nbsp;&nbsp;now if you put it into perspective that we know&nbsp; these interneurons inhibit this neuron right&nbsp;&nbsp;but we also know that these excitatory neurons&nbsp; synapse on to interneurons. That is how they get&nbsp;&nbsp;the signal. It's a feedback. When there's too much&nbsp; excitation the blue circuit goes and tells&nbsp;&nbsp;informs the interneurons okay you need to do&nbsp; something and then they come and stop. So there's&nbsp;&nbsp;input, the brain acts, the inter neurons stop the&nbsp; signal. So that's how the circuit is controlled&nbsp;&nbsp;very simplistically. Now what happens is as we have&nbsp; seen work with the immunohistochemistry and with&nbsp;&nbsp;Rick's data, what if now this excitation here&nbsp; becomes fourfold? Which means this interneuron&nbsp;&nbsp;will now keep getting signals to keep inhibiting&nbsp; the pyramid neuron. This you can see is simple in&nbsp;&nbsp;learning you would you would want some inhibition&nbsp; but not constant inhibition. This would almost be&nbsp;&nbsp;like a constant no-go signal and so that you&nbsp; can kind of try and understand how that would be&nbsp;&nbsp;for a cortex that's trying to learn something new.&nbsp; </p><p>But how is this relevant to seizures? People have&nbsp;&nbsp;done this experiment here. So what we just talked&nbsp; about is exciting GABAergic neurons, exciting these&nbsp;&nbsp;PV interneurons. So they use genetic techniques&nbsp; and, you know, the people used when you introduce a&nbsp;&nbsp;certain protein into specific cell types which is&nbsp; here, these green cells which are the PV interneurons&nbsp;&nbsp;and such that when you shine a blue light&nbsp; on them they all start firing. Okay. So this is&nbsp;&nbsp;a genetic technique and what they're showing here&nbsp; is here's the blue light here are there are green&nbsp;&nbsp;PV interneurons when you shine the blue light,&nbsp; all of them start firing. They start firing. What&nbsp;&nbsp;happens when you shut the blue light? So all of&nbsp; these interneurons are giving a no-go signal&nbsp;&nbsp;to all these interneurons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So that&nbsp; is here. So when the blue light is on&nbsp;&nbsp;they're firing altogether and we just saw how fast&nbsp; they fire. When they are firing there's not even a chance&nbsp;&nbsp;that any of these neurons can fire. So they're all&nbsp; silent these five neurons. What happened when&nbsp;&nbsp;they shut off the light, this group of these are&nbsp; also in the group. Shut off the blue light,&nbsp;&nbsp;this is called synchronous rebound spiking. Now&nbsp; all the neurons... they fire together! They're not&nbsp;&nbsp;supposed to! When they fire together what happened&nbsp; on the EEG? The mouse threw a seizure. So this is&nbsp;&nbsp;kind of reverse thinking where we think \"oh, if the&nbsp; no-go signal is weak that's how seizures come on.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;What this group is showing if the no-go signal is&nbsp; too strong the brain can also throw a seizure. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;this concept has been around in the epilepsy field&nbsp; for many decades but now with newer techniques&nbsp;&nbsp;we are able to prove that this opposite way of&nbsp; throwing seizures is the possibility. </p><p>Now why is&nbsp;&nbsp;this important? I just showed you that there's&nbsp; so much excitation onto the PV interneuron and&nbsp;&nbsp;is that playing a role in these 3 Hertz discharges&nbsp; that the cortexes of the children and the mouse&nbsp;&nbsp;are throwing seizures for? So hopefully this is&nbsp; the summary so basically what I've shown you&nbsp;&nbsp;is we focused on cortical gamma oscillations.&nbsp; These are these low amplitude&nbsp;&nbsp;high frequency, and the wild-type transition high&nbsp; gamma, no gamma. The Syngap Mouse, no transition in&nbsp;&nbsp;fact sometimes it goes a little higher. You block&nbsp; AMPA receptors, it reverts back right away. Back&nbsp;&nbsp;to normal. So this is just the perampanel drawing.&nbsp; It's an AMPA receptor antagonist. So when you give&nbsp;&nbsp;the antagonist you can rescue that and these&nbsp; transitions are associated with these 3 Hertz&nbsp;&nbsp;discharges in the mouse. That's the same discharge&nbsp; in the human. So that's the human EEG and that's&nbsp;&nbsp;the graphic for that and then what I showed you&nbsp; was the immunohistochemistry arm showing as&nbsp;&nbsp;the way because it's the PV in wild-type and you&nbsp; can see the red around here which is here's the&nbsp;&nbsp;neck you know the black and white version of&nbsp; it of showing how many more GluA2 AMPA&nbsp;&nbsp;receptors there are on this interneuron from&nbsp; the Syngap brain versus the wild type. So what we&nbsp;&nbsp;this is denoting is that then this can become a&nbsp; vicious cycle. This hyper excitation can lead to&nbsp;&nbsp;this gamma oscillation disruption. This disruption&nbsp; in transition can lead to seizures. Now do seizure&nbsp;&nbsp;activity again lead to this further disruption in&nbsp; excitation? That would be an interesting question&nbsp;&nbsp;to parse out. So you've seen this before. Now you&nbsp; know you're familiar with what this means for&nbsp;&nbsp;the EEG of this child and so this is basically&nbsp; you summarize the 3 hertz short wave spike wave&nbsp;&nbsp;discharges. Seizures in transition states: wake&nbsp; to sleep, sleep to wake, non-REM to REM. Early&nbsp;&nbsp;morning seizures, which many parents report, the&nbsp; clinicians have reported, and then that would be&nbsp;&nbsp;a huge transition from gamma now suddenly has&nbsp; to go out which then it fails to most likely.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seizure clustering. Seizure clustering is&nbsp; important because if they're not just single&nbsp;&nbsp;events a bunch of seizures themselves can alter&nbsp; circuits and disrupt learning and memory in any&nbsp;&nbsp;child even in adult. So this basically summarizes&nbsp; everything I have said: the non-REM component, why&nbsp;&nbsp;we used perampanel. It was a low dose and how you&nbsp; saw just with a single low dose how it completely&nbsp;&nbsp;altered and that that is increased expression&nbsp; of GluA2 receptors in these PV interneurons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So to summarize: SYNGAP1 patients I said 3&nbsp; Hertz myoclonic seizures, the mouse has the same&nbsp;&nbsp;phenotype. Then children evolved with multiple&nbsp; seizure phenotypes we saw that too. Seizures in our&nbsp;&nbsp;transition states, we saw that. Low sleep efficiency&nbsp; we saw complete disruption of the sleep cycle in&nbsp;&nbsp;the mouse. ADHD is reported in the syndrome&nbsp; and then we saw the hyperactivity. What is novel, which usually&nbsp;&nbsp;people don't look at when they don't look&nbsp; at the background EEG in the clinical EEGs that&nbsp;&nbsp;are done in the children, is this abnormal&nbsp; gamma homeostasis meaning the transition between&nbsp;&nbsp;states for gamma oscillation. Progressive worsening&nbsp; of the epilepsy, which would be good to get from&nbsp;&nbsp;the Natural History/registry that you guys are&nbsp; working on and then this whole focus on GluA2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now why is this important? Perampanel blocks&nbsp; all AMPA receptors. GluA2 is a specific&nbsp;&nbsp;subtype of AMPA receptors and currently there's&nbsp; no drug on the market that just blocks GluA2&nbsp;&nbsp;specifically. So that would be interesting for us&nbsp; to figure out if, you know, to try and either use&nbsp;&nbsp;medicinal chemistry and screen for drugs that&nbsp; would be even more surgically like a scalpel&nbsp;&nbsp;rather than a hammer to block only certain types&nbsp; of AMPA receptors and then maybe we could get away with&nbsp;&nbsp;the side effects. Our future goals is where you&nbsp; know we are collecting EEGs, overnight EEGs with&nbsp;&nbsp;children who have been diagnosed with SYNGAP1&nbsp; and then of course we're looking for different&nbsp;&nbsp;ages because we want to see how this is evolving&nbsp; in children as compared to what we've learned from&nbsp;&nbsp;the mouse. We are now also, we've amended our IRB&nbsp; study to include siblings. If there is a sibling&nbsp;&nbsp;who has or if you can get an overnight EEG for a&nbsp; sibling who does not have SYNGAP1 now that&nbsp;&nbsp;would be the best control for that background&nbsp; genetic background family for us to go to compare&nbsp;&nbsp;sleep cycles with the sibling versus the child&nbsp; with the mutation and of course we will keep&nbsp;&nbsp;testing novel interventions in the mouse that we&nbsp; have characterized but like I mentioned before we&nbsp;&nbsp;are now move to a much younger age and we're doing&nbsp; EEGs in pups. So here is the this is online and I&nbsp;&nbsp;will I will send these links this is the proof&nbsp; study at Hopkins and so basically it involves&nbsp;&nbsp;parents signing a consent form that I will send&nbsp; and if you have any questions like I'm happy to&nbsp;&nbsp;answer them and then what it requires for the&nbsp; parent to do is then sign a release form to&nbsp;&nbsp;whichever clinic or hospital the overnight EEG&nbsp; was done and then the hospital directly sends&nbsp;&nbsp;us the actual recording not the report we are&nbsp; happy to read the report but we want the actual&nbsp;&nbsp;EEG recording the 24 hours or however long it&nbsp; was if it's ambulatory EEG done at home we are&nbsp;&nbsp;happy to take a copy of that too. So that is the&nbsp; study we have been recruiting we have a few EEGs&nbsp;&nbsp;right now and now we're focusing on analyzing it&nbsp; now that we have this data from the mice and some&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding of what this EEG looks like and with&nbsp; that I'll close and acknowledge many Brennan who&nbsp;&nbsp;was is the first author on the paper and did the&nbsp; bulk of the work of the data I've shown you today&nbsp;&nbsp;and then all the people who have been in the lab&nbsp; who have contributed in multiple ways are funding&nbsp;&nbsp;and of course Rick's lab that we wouldn't be doing Syngap&nbsp; research if he had not invited us to&nbsp;&nbsp;join the team and with that I'll thank you for&nbsp; your attention. </p><p>Mike: Thank you Shilpa. If everyone wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;muted I think you hear a lot of clapping and I&nbsp; apologize for being familiar right. I'm so humbled&nbsp;&nbsp;by what I just see I feel like I should call you&nbsp; Dr. Kadam more often but I've just been lucky&nbsp;&nbsp;to talk to you in the past so please forgive the&nbsp; familiarity. I know but you're awesome so I want to&nbsp;&nbsp;just make three points and then I want to point&nbsp; you to some of the questions in the chat.&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. The questions have come from Hans and Marta&nbsp; who are both medical doctors and Syngap parents&nbsp;&nbsp;which is as well as two questions from Aaron who&nbsp; is the medical training as well and so they were&nbsp;&nbsp;able to keep up with you. I think the rest of us&nbsp; are still digesting but point one: you&nbsp;&nbsp;said sibling EEGs. That's actually not&nbsp; as hard as it sounds if you go to someone and&nbsp;&nbsp;say \"hey, can I get a sleep study\" right because a&nbsp; sleep study includes an overnight EEG so if my&nbsp;&nbsp;chubby little two-year-old is having bad sleep&nbsp; I can get someone to ask for a sleep study and&nbsp;&nbsp;there's a sibling for you. </p><p>Dr Kadam: But right but I mean&nbsp; it was are the parents of Syngap children who&nbsp;&nbsp;said that their neurologists for some reason and&nbsp; I'm really not clear on this, asked for or maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;because if they were twins they asked for the&nbsp; sibling the sibling without SYNGAP1 to have&nbsp;&nbsp;an overnight EEG and as a scientist that could&nbsp; be the because we would you know exactly what you&nbsp;&nbsp;said most of our control EEG is because we will&nbsp; have to age match because in children sleep cycles&nbsp;&nbsp;evolve. A three-year-old sleep cycle is not the same&nbsp; as the eight-year-old and so we are going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;getting our control EEGs from the sleep center&nbsp; at CHOP, Children's Hospital in Philadelphia and&nbsp;&nbsp;those kids go for this exact same reason you said&nbsp; that they have some of the child has some sleep&nbsp;&nbsp;problems no genetic disorders and then they get&nbsp; a diagnosis of no problems on the EEG. So we have&nbsp;&nbsp;a collaboration with the investigator there and&nbsp; once we have our cohort we will get age match&nbsp;&nbsp;ages from that Center to kind of compare blindly&nbsp; the Syngap EEG versus the control each year when&nbsp;&nbsp;I became aware that parents did have sibling EEG&nbsp; I actually took the trouble to amend IRB study&nbsp;&nbsp;so that we can also get a copy of the sibling EEG.&nbsp; Will it be very critical? I don't know. Once we have&nbsp;&nbsp;a cohort and we are able to look at it it'll be&nbsp; very interesting to look at the background EEG of&nbsp;&nbsp;the sibling because that would be the best control&nbsp; instead of a child unrelated child with maybe some&nbsp;&nbsp;other disorders that might affect that&nbsp; child EEG but that's the best control we can get&nbsp;&nbsp;so whether it's easy or not is you guys will&nbsp; give me feedback on because I think it happen&nbsp;&nbsp;organically and I found out it's happening I don't&nbsp; know how easy or difficult it'll be for you to go&nbsp;&nbsp;and actively seek sibling EEGs for your&nbsp; children. </p><p>Mike: I'll let you know but the second point&nbsp;&nbsp;and I think the takeaway that anyone who&nbsp; enjoys this presentation will walk away from this&nbsp;&nbsp;is they're gonna do what I did after I read your&nbsp; paper and walk into my neurologists office and&nbsp;&nbsp;say \"hey, could we try perampanel?\" and my neurologist&nbsp; says well, there's a lot of side effects and blah&nbsp;&nbsp;blah blah and then I say yes, but what this paper&nbsp; suggests (and please tell me if my interpretation&nbsp;&nbsp;here is wrong) what this paper suggests is that&nbsp; actually perampanel at the dose that it's&nbsp;&nbsp;currently recommended for is an AED yes, we know&nbsp; has side effects, but this paper suggested&nbsp;&nbsp;at very low levels where maybe we could avoid the&nbsp; side effects perampanel could have an impact&nbsp;&nbsp;that's my first question to you my second one is&nbsp; I just want to draw a thick line under something&nbsp;&nbsp;you said earlier where you pointed out that the&nbsp; same drug at the same quantity at a different&nbsp;&nbsp;time of day yes to the seasonality or whatever the&nbsp; right term is of our kids yours can have radically&nbsp;&nbsp;different impacts and I've seen that just in one&nbsp; of the sleep through that we give our kid guanfacine&nbsp;&nbsp;for sleep and moving that from but we gave it to&nbsp; him for behavior but it turns out to help sleep&nbsp;&nbsp;we move that from morning to evening everything&nbsp; changed. So I just want to emphasize that point&nbsp;&nbsp;you made because I've lived it but the question&nbsp; really is about the perampanel. Is it true when&nbsp;&nbsp;we're talking to our neurologists about this but&nbsp; we are talking about radically lower dosing that&nbsp;&nbsp;is currently indicated at for perampanel as an&nbsp; AED is that right? </p><p>Dr Kadam: A hundred percent. So the current&nbsp;&nbsp;protocol for introducing perampanel to any child (or&nbsp; any adult) is to start with the low doses and then&nbsp;&nbsp;they'll ramp them up over a few weeks and then it&nbsp; goes to they may not even start at&nbsp;&nbsp;2. If they start at 4 the goal is to reach&nbsp; up to 12 milligrams per kilogram. So that is a&nbsp;&nbsp;substantially higher grade of perampanel dosing. But&nbsp; the major point is: if you talk to any parents&nbsp;&nbsp;I've talked to and very few Syngap children have&nbsp; actually got perampanel (that I'm aware of) but other&nbsp;&nbsp;syndromes where perampanel has been tried this is&nbsp; the common complaint that there are multiple&nbsp;&nbsp;side effects. But there's a distinction: there are&nbsp; no side effects when the low dose is on. The side&nbsp;&nbsp;effects come on when they ramp up the dose and&nbsp; then usually people will just stop it. Right. And&nbsp;&nbsp;that's understandable if you do it in an outpatient&nbsp; and you tell your clinician down and now this&nbsp;&nbsp;there's a child sleeping a lot or whatever the&nbsp; problem is with the perampanel dosing.&nbsp;&nbsp;So that's a consistent story. What our data is&nbsp; saying because ours it is so specific let's say,&nbsp;&nbsp;you know, these interneurons are showing this high&nbsp; AMPA receptor, right. So what is the logic behind&nbsp;&nbsp;that? Why is the low dose working or why we&nbsp; think it's working? That only with the low dose.&nbsp;&nbsp;The side effects come when the high dose block&nbsp; most activity right? That's where the sleepiness&nbsp;&nbsp;comes in and all the side effects come in. </p><p>Why is&nbsp; the low dose working here? There are few cells as I&nbsp;&nbsp;just showed you that have this very high level of&nbsp; AMPA receptors. So if you gave a low dose that&nbsp;&nbsp;same brain what would that the maximum effect of&nbsp; the low dose would be on the cells that have the&nbsp;&nbsp;highest AMPA receptors. Not on all the other cells&nbsp; and so the understanding would be that you could&nbsp;&nbsp;get away with the low dose which has no side&nbsp; effects but have the most highest therapeutic&nbsp;&nbsp;effect on the cells that have abnormally high&nbsp; level of AMPA receptors and remember Syngap is&nbsp;&nbsp;the only one that I'm aware of as a development&nbsp; disorder where the specific pathology of high&nbsp;&nbsp;AMPA receptor insertion is understood. Thanks&nbsp; to Rick's lab. Most of the other epilepsy there's&nbsp;&nbsp;in general high excitability which&nbsp; they given perampanel to block the entire brain&nbsp;&nbsp;from seizing so here perampanel would almost act&nbsp; like a scalpel instead of a hammer it could be&nbsp;&nbsp;for us it would be even better if we found a drug&nbsp; that was only GluA2 specific which does not&nbsp;&nbsp;exist (but might in the future) and the idea is&nbsp; absolutely right then that this paradigm does&nbsp;&nbsp;not exist for neurologists right now they only&nbsp; understand the start to the low dose and ramp up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For a me as a scientist it's very clear that&nbsp; the side effects are coming when the ramping&nbsp;&nbsp;up happens not when the drug is just given in the&nbsp; low dose. So that's one thing to consider. And two: if&nbsp;&nbsp;the seizures are coming because of the disruption&nbsp; of gamma oscillation then maybe (and we will test&nbsp;&nbsp;this out) maybe just a low dose perampanel is&nbsp; enough for the Syngap child. It may not be true&nbsp;&nbsp;for any other syndrome it's very specific to&nbsp; the SYNGAP1 mutation. The second important&nbsp;&nbsp;point you said was when is this drug being given?&nbsp; So right now Syngap is given you know usually&nbsp;&nbsp;twice a day so you usually with an 8 hour difference,&nbsp; sometime in the morning, sometime before bed. What&nbsp;&nbsp;if we as we look at more EEGs and we figure out&nbsp; that these transition points are when the child&nbsp;&nbsp;is most vulnerable and... now if you look at all&nbsp; the transition points I talked about is wake to&nbsp;&nbsp;sleep, sleep to wake, REM to non REM. All these are&nbsp; now tied to the sleep cycle. So if the only&nbsp;&nbsp;dose if it's given only once a day is given right&nbsp; before sleep and then your biggest side effect is&nbsp;&nbsp;sleepiness then you counter both. It's a win-win.&nbsp; And then you don't give it in the morning... and this&nbsp;&nbsp;is all hypothetical right now okay, so I'm just&nbsp; talking about the fact that what we are seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;and how the drug would be best given. This has&nbsp; to be parsed out in the clinic. So those are the&nbsp;&nbsp;two times yes the time point when you're giving&nbsp; the drug. What are is known side-effects? When are&nbsp;&nbsp;you expecting the most seizures to happen&nbsp; in the child? And then why would you give it in&nbsp;&nbsp;the time when it's not needed? So those&nbsp; are the points of things that I'm hoping as we&nbsp;&nbsp;start talking about this data with neurologists&nbsp; is changing paradigms and protocols in clinic is very&nbsp;&nbsp;difficult. People do not... and I'm not even aware how&nbsp; this ramping up dosing protocols came into&nbsp;&nbsp;place like who tested it out how was it tested&nbsp; out and you may know that Takeda now is actually&nbsp;&nbsp;testing out the use of perampanel now in children&nbsp; less than two years of age for safety. As a safety&nbsp;&nbsp;trial. So it's moving in the right direction. These&nbsp; two points are very critical. Why would you ramp&nbsp;&nbsp;up if, based on the pathology, a low dose would&nbsp; be actually the best way to go? And then secondly,&nbsp;&nbsp;why would you give it multiple times&nbsp; a day if you want to just focus on the most&nbsp;&nbsp;vulnerable time when the brain is seizing? So those&nbsp; are the two things. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Thank you. I know we're over&nbsp;&nbsp;time but people aren't going anywhere because I&nbsp;think they're also enthralled. Have I forced muted&nbsp;&nbsp;everybody? Should I unmute you Martha and&nbsp; Hans and Aaron so you guys can ask your questions?&nbsp;&nbsp;Here Hans I'll unmute you. I'll try to - it's not&nbsp; working. Martha are you muted? </p><p>Marta: I'm here, yeah. I have&nbsp;&nbsp;to use a different one because the connection&nbsp; is bad. My question is: did you notice any&nbsp;&nbsp;difference on the behavior of the mouse after&nbsp;with the Fycompa? Did you notice that they have the activity improve or something? </p><p>Dr Kadam: So that's what we're doing now. We're&nbsp; actually... we are going to start looking at not&nbsp;&nbsp;only how their behavior changes but how their&nbsp; behavior is behavior testing for cognition&nbsp;&nbsp;sure what we're going to see but now we know&nbsp; what we expect to see now questions to be asked.</p><p>Mike: Thank You Hans, Aaron do you want to chime in&nbsp; with your questions like one to two seconds&nbsp;&nbsp;with like a 3.5 to 4 Hertz frequency oftentimes&nbsp; the colleges are you observing those same kinds&nbsp;&nbsp;of patterns in the mice and then also would you&nbsp; classify those as seizures as well? </p><p>Dr Kadam: that's a very&nbsp;&nbsp;good question and and that brings us to the point&nbsp; of just animal modeling so that's why I mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp;what the similarities were but obviously a mouse&nbsp; is not not a child and we do when I said short&nbsp;&nbsp;duration myoclonic seizures they are sharp but&nbsp; they are not like 1 or 2 seconds long. We do see&nbsp;&nbsp;one or two second long seizures that are not&nbsp; the typical spike. I showed you the one where&nbsp;&nbsp;the EMG was completely silent. So in that sense&nbsp; it's not the exact phenotype which by the way&nbsp;&nbsp;there is no such mouse model of epilepsy where&nbsp; you have the exact human phenotype especially&nbsp;&nbsp;not for genetic epilepsy. The closest we get&nbsp; is with temporal lobe epilepsy where there's&nbsp;&nbsp;very high seizure frequency and there's&nbsp; only one type of generalized tonic-clonic&nbsp;&nbsp;seizure but coming back to your more important&nbsp; question is when neurologists, when there's a short&nbsp;&nbsp;duration discharge and that's not classified as&nbsp; a seizure that's just the nomenclature and it's&nbsp;&nbsp;important for classification in the clinic and the&nbsp; reporting but as a neuroscientist, any epileptiform&nbsp;&nbsp;discharge we know, even a single spike, people have&nbsp; shown disrupts the learning memory circuit in the&nbsp;&nbsp;hippocampus. So whether it's a one second or two&nbsp; second discharge versus a four second discharge&nbsp;&nbsp;for me as a scientist that's still important to&nbsp; identify and quantify and human EEGs really do&nbsp;&nbsp;not go into that level of granular... it's almost ironic that&nbsp; we use much higher resolution and granularity&nbsp;&nbsp;when we quantify the mouse EEG but the similar&nbsp; thing does not happen even with these overnight&nbsp;&nbsp;EEGs when there are multiple seizure&nbsp; events. Like, for example, the work, the&nbsp;&nbsp;quantification and the trace I showed you for&nbsp; the one child. The report did not say how many&nbsp;&nbsp;events happened or where they happened. We had to&nbsp; go and identify them and clock the time and&nbsp;&nbsp;superimpose it on to the underlying power and the&nbsp; sleep EEG. So basically to shorten that answer: yes in&nbsp;&nbsp;the clinic a short duration epileptiform discharge&nbsp; is not classified as a seizure band but for a&nbsp;&nbsp;neuroscientist if a normal brain is not having&nbsp; that kind of episode we know for a fact even&nbsp;&nbsp;short duration discharges can disrupt circuits&nbsp; and that's why it's important to us.</p><p>Mike:Amazing. Hans?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Hans:&nbsp;Can you hear me okay? Yeah. Great, thanks so much&nbsp; for the great talk. I just had a question because I&nbsp;&nbsp;believe Gavin and maybe Jimmy had a paper showing&nbsp; a diminishment in interictal spiking when SynGAP&nbsp;&nbsp;expression was sort of turned on I believe with a&nbsp; floxed Mouse. Is interictal spiking something&nbsp;&nbsp;seen universally in our in our children or is it&nbsp; something hit or miss? </p><p>Dr Kadam: That's a very good question.&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have not started to quantify just spikes&nbsp; in the EEGs. We are still collecting. Once we have a&nbsp;&nbsp;good cohort and that's why we are urging parents&nbsp; to send us, or participate in our IRB study.&nbsp;&nbsp;For sure the report does not tell you how many&nbsp; interictal spikes there were. Even in the one&nbsp;&nbsp;that- so far the ones we've seen I have not noted&nbsp; a lot of interictal spikes. Yes, we've seen the seizure&nbsp;&nbsp;events but although they are the 3 Hertz&nbsp; seizures that I was trying to correlate&nbsp;&nbsp;between the mouse, they're not exactly the same&nbsp; and the short duration high frequency 3 Hertz&nbsp;&nbsp;spike wave discharges that are commonly&nbsp; reported even in the reports are very unique but&nbsp;&nbsp;they're not unique to send get and I don't know&nbsp; even from the literature how many of when when&nbsp;&nbsp;the epilepsy phenotype is predominantly 3 Hertz&nbsp; spike wave discharges how many how what what role&nbsp;&nbsp;do in trickle spikes play in that epilepsy and&nbsp; that that literature is not that strong I would&nbsp;&nbsp;assume it and it's never come my way and even&nbsp; for the few EEGs we have looked at from the&nbsp;&nbsp;clinic intraictal spikes of course they occur but&nbsp; almost not at the frequency at which we see it in&nbsp;&nbsp;the mice and this is I mean this is pre and this&nbsp; is premature at this point because we have not&nbsp;&nbsp;yet looked at multiple EEGs and so there it'll&nbsp; be interesting to see whether certain children&nbsp;&nbsp;who have the same phenotype but have a lot of&nbsp; integral spikes that'll be very interesting so&nbsp;&nbsp;both yes that is important point to look at the&nbsp; ones we've looked at we don't have a very high&nbsp;&nbsp;predominance of intrical spikes but that does&nbsp; not mean that there aren't send your children&nbsp;&nbsp;but there's lots of literature to show because&nbsp; they are people are using Medtronic companies that&nbsp;&nbsp;are implanting units onto the scalp of&nbsp; patients is you are using a Gotham's to quantitate&nbsp;&nbsp;interictal spikes to be able to predict when&nbsp; that adult is most likely going to have a seizure.&nbsp;&nbsp;So the idea being that then the patient will&nbsp; be injected with the drug or the or the anti&nbsp;&nbsp;drug into the focus of wherever the seizure is&nbsp; starting and that's that's a new way of therapy&nbsp;&nbsp;for in temporal lobe epilepsy or cortical lesions&nbsp; so that's where interictal spike research is very&nbsp;&nbsp;very strong. It's it's strong because it's being&nbsp; used as a predictive marker for oncoming epilepsy&nbsp;&nbsp;but in developmental disorders spikes do happen. In&nbsp; Rett syndrome in their EEGs and they always&nbsp;&nbsp;come in non-REM. What they mean for seizure&nbsp; prediction is an interesting question that I&nbsp;&nbsp;don't think people have yet started looking in&nbsp; very young children. Does that answer your question?</p><p>Mike: He's muted. Yeah. Hans? </p><p>Hans:&nbsp;It sounds like it remains&nbsp; to be seen based on a survey of child, Syngap&nbsp;&nbsp;child EEGs, whether or not they have comparable&nbsp; interictal spiking. </p><p>Dr Kadam:&nbsp;Correct. Correct. Okay great.&nbsp;&nbsp;And in Rett syndrome we know there's massive&nbsp; interictal spiking. I'm not seeing that- yes&nbsp;&nbsp;once it's characterized in the clinic that'll be&nbsp; very important. It will give us a lot of important&nbsp;&nbsp;insights. </p><p>Hans: Great, thank you. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;And so just conscious of time, next steps we're gonna&nbsp;&nbsp;share out the recording of this pretty quickly&nbsp; and then Dr. Kadam, if you can share the link to that&nbsp;&nbsp;study you're doing we will make sure&nbsp; to push that out as well. </p><p>Dr Kadam:&nbsp;Yeah I'll send you an&nbsp;&nbsp;email right there this is done both I'll attach&nbsp; both the forms and you can review them if you&nbsp;&nbsp;have any questions please feel free I'll send my&nbsp; email address too and and we are, we are trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;collect these overnight EEGs.If you have&nbsp; multiple, in the sense that your child&nbsp;&nbsp;when they were three they had one and then they&nbsp; had one again when they were six that would be&nbsp;&nbsp;priceless for us because then we would have a&nbsp; temporal progression EEG for the same child and&nbsp;&nbsp;then if you guys have a you know one if you guys&nbsp; talked you know and figure out whether sibling EEG&nbsp;&nbsp;is something global please let me know and also&nbsp; let me know how I can help. </p><p>Peter:&nbsp;Dr. Kadam, just to&nbsp;&nbsp;follow up on that question, if we have an EEG from&nbsp; after the child is two years old and one from just&nbsp;&nbsp;before they're two years old overnight EEG would&nbsp; that still beneficial? Yes it's only unfortunately because&nbsp;&nbsp;of how the IRBs were initially written and&nbsp; special forms need to be filled when the child is&nbsp;&nbsp;less than two years old I will have to write the&nbsp; amendment to get an EEG that's from a child&nbsp;&nbsp;is less than two years old. So right now we are&nbsp; approved from two years old to 16 years old but I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;working on the amendment so at this point if you&nbsp; have one that's over two years old you can send&nbsp;&nbsp;that to us and then once the amendment is&nbsp; done the consent form will already be&nbsp;&nbsp;with us I'll just send you the updated amendment&nbsp; and then you can send me the earlier EEGs.Sounds good. Which is, I mean I don't know but it's very&nbsp;&nbsp;interesting for us as we're finding that there is&nbsp; one subgroup of children that is having seizures&nbsp;&nbsp;and severe serious very early on and the registry and&nbsp; the clinicians who are working on this better they&nbsp;&nbsp;characterize this the better it will be for the&nbsp; field moving forward because definitely something&nbsp;&nbsp;that's happening in the brain that's less&nbsp; than two years old it's a whole different&nbsp;&nbsp;ballgame then something is happening at five&nbsp; years old and of course that the class of drugs&nbsp;&nbsp;changes because most drugs are not approved to be&nbsp; given for that younger child. So then that's why&nbsp;&nbsp;management becomes different and then so then&nbsp; the science needs to match what's happening at the&nbsp;&nbsp;bedside and so then we have to start thinking that&nbsp; way. The more we know the better we will do. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Marta any other questions&nbsp; before I wrap it up? </p><p>Marta:&nbsp;My question is about the&nbsp;&nbsp;age. With my daughter she's 17 she's one of&nbsp; the oldest that then connected then you said it's&nbsp;16 years old...?</p><p>Dr Kadam: So if extending it beyond 16 is not a&nbsp; problem because out there there are no extra rules&nbsp;&nbsp;and regulations with the two-year-old child we&nbsp; less than two years old we have to&nbsp;fill these extra forms&nbsp;so now if I'm going to do&nbsp; the amendment is that the only EEG she has is after&nbsp;&nbsp;16? </p><p>Marta: No no no, she has, I actually had several of them&nbsp; to send you. The other question is: she's probably&nbsp;&nbsp;one of the few that doesn't have any seizures during&nbsp; EEG. Or at least reported. </p><p>Dr Kadam:&nbsp;And you see...?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Marta: She doesn't have any activity&nbsp; reported and then but it still theta. EEG is abnormal&nbsp;&nbsp;they're not... </p><p>Dr Kadam:&nbsp;100% so I mean those are some&nbsp; of the most valuable EEGs because we know that seizure&nbsp;&nbsp;events also have effect on these background&nbsp; oscillations. So if there is a recording of EEG&nbsp;&nbsp;where it is not a single event that will also&nbsp; provide additional insights and also like I&nbsp;&nbsp;said, these seizure events most likely also are&nbsp; dependent on the age. So there may be ages where&nbsp;&nbsp;the child is more vulnerable to higher seizure&nbsp; events and there may be \"honeymoon periods\" as have&nbsp;&nbsp;been shown in other development disorders and we don't&nbsp; know what that is for SYNGAP1 and what is&nbsp;&nbsp;the range or whether there are specific stages&nbsp; and whether all children fit in that stage or&nbsp;&nbsp;there are mostly outliers. All of this information&nbsp; hopefully now will start trickling in as more and&nbsp;&nbsp;more people start getting involved. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Can&nbsp; I...? So I'm gonna wrap it up unless anyone's&nbsp;&nbsp;got a burning question. I want to thank everyone&nbsp; especially the people from the Kadam lab for their&nbsp;&nbsp;time. Do you mind going back quickly to slide 8?&nbsp; I just think this is... I thought that was a super&nbsp;&nbsp;cool slide but I didn't want to interrupt&nbsp; you. That diagram is amazing because I think that's&nbsp;&nbsp;what we live through right? We have young kids the&nbsp; P60 who were only having myoclonic seizures and&nbsp;&nbsp;the parents aren't sure and they go to doctors&nbsp; and they go to neurologists and they take videos&nbsp;&nbsp;and people say they're not sure and it takes time&nbsp; and then a few years later, proxied by the P120's,&nbsp;&nbsp;we have kids who are sure having seizures and&nbsp; we start seeing different phenotypes. So point&nbsp;&nbsp;1: I just think this slide really as a&nbsp; Syngap parent and someone who talks to Syngap&nbsp;&nbsp;parents every day really speaks to me and I&nbsp; think it's awesome. That's point one. Point&nbsp;&nbsp;two is I just want to highlight for the&nbsp; parents generally, this is what we- this is why SRF&nbsp;&nbsp;exists right? To connect parents and scientists. To&nbsp; emphasize the great work that scientists are doing.&nbsp;There's a lot of names on that last slide but Dr.&nbsp; Kadam has been someone who's taken our calls and&nbsp;&nbsp;talk to us many times. Brennan who's the first&nbsp; author on that paper is someone who was at our&nbsp;&nbsp;round table last year and as a young researcher&nbsp; and someone we're excited to see stay in Syngap&nbsp;&nbsp;for a long time. So this has been a great&nbsp; webinar and I'm so grateful and the third point&nbsp;&nbsp;is just to build on that and say thank you. This was great. This paper's amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully we'll have more kids on perampanel. I think&nbsp; offline will ask you about why we wouldn't just&nbsp;&nbsp;do a study. But thank you so much for the work&nbsp; you do, for your lab, for this paper and for doing&nbsp;&nbsp;this webinar. Thank you. </p><p>Dr Kadam: Thank you guys and thank&nbsp; you for the opportunity. I mean the feedback from&nbsp;&nbsp;parents has been one of the biggest motivation&nbsp; for my group for Brennan for sure and and yeah&nbsp;&nbsp;and for us as as researchers getting inputs of&nbsp; what's happening in the life of the patient and&nbsp;&nbsp;even in the family because quality of life&nbsp; is an important component of us understanding. You&nbsp;&nbsp;know \"cure\" is one thing but there are many ways in&nbsp; which you can improve categories of the disease&nbsp;&nbsp;and so although we can keep cure on the horizon&nbsp; as the goal where we are headed to, we cannot miss all&nbsp;&nbsp;these side routes where we can make substantial&nbsp; improvements in the management and understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;of how the disease is progressing and that&nbsp; only comes from communication so thank you&nbsp;&nbsp;guys for this. Thank you so much that was very good.&nbsp; Thank you I appreciate it. Thank you. Bye bye guys.</p>",

He is a professor of neuroscience, psychological and brain science at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine where he has been since 1988. In 2006 he also became the director of the Solomon H. Snyder department of neuroscience and we are proud to have him as the chair of the SRF Scientific Advisory Board. Dr Huganir has been interested in the science of learning and memory since his early childhood. His desire to understand the biochemical processes of learning have led to a career focused on investigating mechanisms that regulate synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity, including the molecular mechanisms that regulate neurotransmitter receptor function. This has included research on glutamate receptors to better understand how the phosphorylation of these receptors modifies some of their functions related to learning and memory in cell models. In addition his lab studies the processes by which certain types of these receptors, AMPA receptors, are recruited to and regulated at synapses where they play an important role in the connections between synapses. </p><p>His work with the SYNGAP1 gene and its protein has evolved since 1998 when he first discovered that the SYNGAP1 gene's protein plays an important role in regulating synaptic plasticity. Since then his lab has also created mouse models which reflect human mutations in SYNGAP1 and have characterized the resulting phenotypes. Potential routes to therapeutic treatment of Syngap disorders is another focus of his lab and that is what he's here to share with us about today. Earlier this year he published a review titled \"20 years of SynGAP research from synapses to cognition\" where you can read more about the many advances he has contributed to in our understanding of SynGAP. </p><p>At the end of this presentation you'll have an opportunity to get your questions answered.

For those of you just joining us, welcome to our talk today by Dr. Richard Huganir titled \"Rescue of SynGAP expression in SYNGAP1 Syndrome: Antisense Oligonucleotides, small molecules, and viral genetic rescue\". You'll be able to find a recorded version of this talk on the SRF website as well as on SRF's YouTube channel. So now it is my great privilege to hand this over to Dr. Huganir. Thank you so much for being with us today.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Here is the transcript:</h2><p>Dr Huganir: Great, thank you Sydney. It's a real pleasure and honor to be here speaking to parents again and it's really been a pleasure to work with Mike and Ashley and SRF in, you know, helping promote the research and also to help develop therapies and engaging biotech companies and and many many other researchers to push this field forward. So I thought what I'd do today is give a little introduction to SynGAP and many of you know about it but I thought I'd give an introduction and how we got into it over 20 years ago now and then also talk about some of our approaches using mouse models to generate models of SynGAP haploinsufficiency, and then talk about some of our approaches we're taking to try to develop therapeutics, so using antisense oligo treatments and then but at the end I'd be happy to talk about other approaches, small molecule approaches or AAV type rescue approaches and I'll briefly talk about, at the end, looking at different splice forms of SynGAP. Because as many of you know, or will discover today, there are many different forms of SynGAP and they all don't work in the same way. And so to deliver a, to rescue, SynGAP expression using an AAV or viral type rescue approaches we really can only rescue one isotype at a time and so we really need to know which ones are the key isoforms to rescue. So, can you see my cursor, Sydney?</p><p>Okay, so I'll just start out with the brain, of course, the brain is a 100 billion neurons in humans and it's an obviously extremely complex organ and here's a video I'd like to show, it's an animation of signaling between neurons in the brain. So these are all neurons and you can see the action potentials and the electrical signals going between these various neurons. So there are 100 billion neurons and each of these neurons connect to about 10,000 or so other neurons at specialized areas called synapses. And here we're zooming in on the synapse right here and this is where the neurons communicate with each other through a process called synaptic transmission. <br>So here is one neuron touching another neuron. So if we zoom on this, into this schematic here, here is one neuron, the end of the neuron, it's called the axon terminal and this is the second neuron and this is where the synaptic transmission is going to occur. So it's a blow up of this contact here of the synapse. And what happens is an electrical signal comes down, releases neurotransmitters which then go across this gap between the two neurons and activates receptors. And this process of signaling is how the brain works. It is forming a network of neurons communicating with each other through circuits and these circuits are of course what underlies all our behaviors, all our intellect, our emotions and all brain function.</p><p>So as Sydney mentioned, we've been studying synapses and particularly receptors for many years. How these receptors work (shown here) and how a modification of receptor function may be involved in dynamic regulation of synaptic strength and thereby circuits in the brain and we think this is really critical for what we call \"synaptic plasticity\" and processes such as learning and memory. So we've been studying this by looking at phosphorylation of receptors I've mentioned these are, I won't go into detail but these modify receptor's function and then also we've been studying... this is a reversible process...and then also we've been studying how these receptors work.</p><p>So here is a schematic of a neurotransmitter receptor, one of the most major receptors in the brain, AMPA receptors, and we study how this receptor is regulated both by adding these phosphate groups but also by how they are trafficked to synapses and how they interact with proteins that regulate this trafficking of receptors to the synapse. So over the last 25 years or so we've been studying the regulation of receptors and we characterize a variety of proteins that interact with the receptors and regulate their targeting to synapses and this is where we discovered the SynGAP in 1998. So we were identifying proteins that bound together to form this complex and we were able to identify this protein called SynGAP. At the same time Mary Kennedy also was studying synaptic proteins and she identified SynGAP by studying high abundance proteins in synapses and it turns out SynGAP is one of the highest abundance proteins at a synapse. So she was able to identify it as well.</p><p>So SynGAP is a really key for regulation of synaptic function as I'll show you and the one of the key molecular mechanisms we study is a process called synaptoplasticity and this is occurs during learning and memory and other higher brain processes and it's a process where receptors are recruited to the synapse and added to the synapse and this actually increases the synaptic strength. This increases the synaptic communication between neurons and this is really key during the learning process to form a circuit that would encode, for example, a memory. This process can also go the opposite direction so if you look at something called LTD or synaptic depression, receptors can be recruited away from the synapse and weaken synapses. So this process of weakening and strengthening synapses is really key for all brain function and in particular we've studied its role in learning and memory and other other forms of learning. </p><p>So coming back to this again: SynGAP was a key to this and so we've started to study this in learning and the way we did this back in the day and also continue to today is generate mouse models where we delete SynGAP and then ask the question: does deletion of SynGAP regulate learning, behavior, or development? And so we did this in the early 2000s and just to show you how beautiful SynGAP can be here's a picture of SynGAP in a neuron. So this is a neuron that's been filled with a red protein shown here and all these little green dots are actually SynGAP which are located at synapses. So each one of these little dots here is a synapse so you can see it's located at the tip of these sort of projections which are called synaptic spines and it's decorated by SynGAP. </p><p>So SynGAP is, the structure of SynGAP is shown here. It's a protein that has several different domains and I'll talk about how there are many different forms of SynGAP but we and Mary immediately recognized that it had a what's called a GAP domain, identifying it as a GTPase-activating protein which I'll talk about briefly in a minute. So this is my newest favorite picture of SynGAP. It's a beautiful picture taken by Yoichi Araki in my laboratory just again showing the beautiful synaptic localization of SynGAP along the dendrites. Each one of these is an individual synapse.</p><p>‍<br>So as I mentioned SynGAP is a RAS GAP and I'm not going to go into detail but these RAS GAPs have been studied for for decades and they're involved in regulation of signaling molecules and again i'm not going to go into the details. So we knew something about its function, that it probably would be regulating RAS signaling in neurons and to study this further as I mentioned we did a deletion of SynGAP gene in mice.</p><p>So interestingly when we knock out the gene for SynGAP, in the homozygote, so if you knock out both copies of the gene, the mice actually die within a few days after birth, you know, about three or four days after birth, but the heterozygotes are fine they live a normal life they breed relatively well but it turned out they had significant cognitive and behavioral deficits as well as deficits in plasticity. So this is a classic form of plasticity I mentioned earlier LTP, long-term potentiation, and what we're looking at here on the left is just the strength of synaptic transmission.</p><p>So we just start out with a baseline. So we're measuring this electrophysiologically in a slice of brain from mice and if you record synaptic responses, it's very stable until you give this sort of induction protocol which induces LTP. This long-term potentiation that's thought to be involved in learning and memory. And this is a wild-type littermate. So this is a sibling of a heterozygote knockout. So this has two copies of Syngap. You can see you get a nice strengthening of synapses about threefold. In contrast, this is the littermate which is a heterozygote. So this is a brother or sister of these these mice and you can see this potentiation is strongly inhibited. <br>So these mice have very strong deficit in plasticity but they also have a variety of deficits and behaviors and so just one example I'd like to show is a working memory and this is a standard assay we use to look at mice behavior. When you put a mouse in a Y maze like this it'll run back and forth for a few minutes sort of exploring the neighborhood and it will seek out and seek out novel areas. So when it comes to this choice point it will always go to the arm not the arm it came from but it will go to a novel arm and this is so it should alternate if it remembers where it's been it's going to alternate and go down on the alternate arm. And this can be seen here. Here's a wild type animal. If the mouse was just making random choices at the center of the Y maze it would be a 50% but if he was seeking out novel, forging for novel spaces he would remember where he's been and he'll take the alternative arm each time it reaches that choice point. So this is a standard response. About 70 to 80 percent of the time mice will take the alternative arm and in contrast the heterozygote basically just randomly chooses one arm or the other. Interestingly, if we observe this they actually do these repetitive behaviors. They'll go back and forth, back and forth, between two arms. </p><p>So I'm not going to go into all the details but over 10 years of work, 15 years of work or so we came up with a model for how SynGAP is working during plasticity during LTP and so here SynGAP is tightly associated with the synapse as shown here. It's bound to this complex that's involved in interacting with receptors as well during LTP the induction of plasticity actually what happens and i'm not showing any of this data but what happens is actually SynGAP will leave the synapse and this will allow activation of downstream signaling which is really required for plasticity and what we see is that the synapse not only gets more receptors as I described earlier but also becomes larger so this normal plasticity in heterozygote does not occur and so what is shown here is that in normal neurons we have a relatively small size of synapses these little spine like modules but in the SynGAP mutations the synapses are already activated it already has a lot of receptors and the synapse is already big just to illustrate this further this is a figure from the recent review that during LTP induction you would have this structure shown here with receptors and synapses and the synaptic scaffold during LTP you get more receptors and you get the size of the synapse increases. In contrast when when the SynGAP is only fifty percent there with the haploinsufficiency the synapse is already big because the signaling is already activated because SynGAP is gone and it does not - no longer responds - to any stimulation as shown here.</p><p>So SynGAP also is involved in a variety of other properties of the synapse and I'm not going to get into this in too much detail today. It's involved in signaling but we also think it's involved in the structure of the synapse. As I mentioned, it's a very abundant protein in synapses and so you can see here that the the scaffold of the synapse is schematized here and in a paper published in 2016 in collaboration with Mingjie Zhang's laboratory we found that SynGAP is really important we think for the structure this actual physical structure of the synapse.</p><p>‍<br>Now this paper like many of us changed the way we think about SynGAP and really change the direction of the SynGAP team in my laboratory as you know this also changed Gavin Rumbaugh's research program as well to really... because it showed that SynGAP not only was important for learning and behavior in mice but was really critical for human cognition as well. So of course this is the a paper by Jacques Michaud's laboratory which discovered the first three<br>mutations in SynGAP that led to intellectual disability and these are the first three girls having severe mutations in SynGAP that likely lead to haploinsufficiency, destabilization of the message in one copy of the gene. So these individuals are likely just like our heterozygote, they have one good copy and then they have a mutated copy which is probably not producing protein. </p><p>So recently we've of course this then expanded tremendously and there are hundreds of children as you know and probably thousands, probably ranging into tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands. So this has become one of the most common mutations in underlying non-syndromic intellectual disability, ranging from 0.5 to 1% and it's really a, you know, critical underlying cause of intellectual disability. Now we it's been a real honor to get associated with the families and with both SynGAP Research Fund but also Bridge the Gap family foundation. It's really been an honor to meet all of the parents and you know many if some of you have come to our laboratory and come to Kennedy Krieger Institute at Johns Hopkins. It's really been motivating for my students and and postdocs to understand SynGAP and also develop therapies for SynGAP.</p><p>So here are some of the mutations that this is a figure from our review just showing that there are many many different mutations in SynGAP across the exons shown here, exons and introns. And so many of these we think are haploinsufficient, lead to haloinsufficiency we could talk more about this later most of these are nonsense mutations but some are missense mutations, some are frame shifts, truncations, splice site variants, and so it's not clear if all of these lead to haploinsufficiency but I think that and most of them will lead to a haploinsufficiency. So we've started to make some mouse models based on these mutations and this is all unpublished work so here we honor this young girl to make her mutation and this is a really severe mutation and we predicted this would lead to to haploinsufficiency and so we generated a mouse with exactly the same mutation and bred this mouse out and again this is, we're looking at the heterozygote, and here what we're doing is we're looking at ex- in this mouse what is the level of SynGAP expression. And so here you can see this is a what we call a western blot where we're probing four different splice variants of SynGAP and you can see that indeed, just like the heterozygote knockout, this is the old knockout we made in 2000 or so, it's 50 percent of SynGAP expression and in this new mouse the mouse model of this mutation it's basically exactly the same that she has. We would predict that she had 50 percent of synthetic expression in her brain.</p><p>So looking at the behavior of this mutant versus the conventional knockout, so this is the conventional knockout I showed you earlier, the working memory is deficit. Here's the wild type littermates. Here's the mutation, the knockout. This is the new patient mutation. Very similar it's, you know, it's littermate it is fine but this mutation leads to a poor working memory. Now these mice are also hyperactive and so you can measure this in many ways but here you see an increase in activity in mutation in the patient mutation but also in the normal heterozygote knockout and we also as I mentioned there's repetitive behaviors and here we can see this repetitive behavior in the Y maze in the patient mutation but also in the heterozygote knockout. So we're characterizing this mouse further and and these mice will be useful to study, you know, mechanism of SynGAP function but also for testing therapeutics to try to as we'll talk about and shortly test methods to raise the expression of SynGAP from the 50% back up to 100 percent.</p><p>So recently we've also generated mouse model SynGAP splice site mutation and so this splice site is shown here we thought this was an interesting variant because it's actually located in an intron and would promote a cryptic splice site but it's interesting because it's really near the end of the gene it's near the end of the gene and we thought maybe because it was so close to the end of the gene that this RNA would be stable it would produce some protein and possibly this mutation would not lead to a decrease in in SynGAP expression. So we generated this mutation using CRISPR techniques in a mouse model and somewhat surprising we found that the RNA was was unstable and we see about 50% of the RNA but importantly also we saw fifty percent of SynGAP expression at the protein level maybe a little bit of more of the beta isoform which i'll talk about later but really essentially a 50% of SynGAP expression. So this argues that both the severe truncating mutation and also a more subtle splice site mutation is leading to haploinsufficiency. </p><p>So we are going to make maybe one or two more mouse models for example make a missense mutation which should produce protein in theory and we're going to test that in vivo in the mouse model, make the mutation and see if protein expression is normal. In many instead of our preliminary studies we think that a lot of these missense mutations actually destabilize the protein and so they may be haploinsufficient as well.</p><p>So coming to therapeutics, so if most of these mutations are haploinsufficiencies they have 50% of the protein, the most straightforward and the safest way to rescue and try to develop a therapy is to increase the expression of the SynGAP up to 100% and so there as many of you know there are um there's been recent success using uh anti-sense oligonucleotides or ASOs to to do exactly this to modify the expression of genes in many different diseases so I'm not going to go through this in too much detail but I want to point out there are many different ways you can use an ASO.</p><p>ASO is a small oligonucleotide shown here and it's used to bind to regions within the gene so for example in in this schematic shown here an ASO would be a synthesized that would bind to the the RNA of the gene, Syngap for example, and this ASO would be designed so it would recruit a protein called rnase h and this would chew up the RNA so it would destroy the RNA and lead to degradation of the protein. So this is not what we want to do because this would actually decrease the SynGAP expression further but we have a little twist on this which I'll talk about in a minute. We're using this approach in sort of a novel way. There are other ways to regulate expression using ASOs. You can decrease the expression by binding to the start site and inhibiting expression but one of note is as shown here (this is called splicing modulation) and in this case what you do is you use ASOs to either increase or decrease with the efficient splicing alternative splicing and this will either increase or decrease the production of the protein and this technique is what's been working so well in Spinal Muscular Atrophy and has shown success in several other disorders as well. <br>In the Syngap case this is the approach that Stoke Therapeutics at least is taking in a pre-clinical level to try to use these ASOs to increase SynGAP expression.<br>So the twist we took is that we were interested at looking at the Syngap gene. Here's the Syngap gene shown on chromosome six. You can see all the exons shown here and what was unique about this is that it turned out there was an antisense strand. So there's actually a gene that is read in the opposite direction. The RNase starts here and it's read in this direction but it overlaps with Syngap. It has a very similar sequence it's called an antisense transcript and this gene is not encoding a protein but it's actually just encoding a non-coding RNA, a small RNA. Now why this is interesting is that this antisenses usually regulate the expression of this homologous gene so this RNA could in theory regulate the expression of SynGAP. So we looked at this in more detail and interestingly this antisense transcript is only found in a human brain and not in mouse and rat and this is a problem of course for our studies if we want to study in mouse and rat systems but we are, you know, starting to look at this in the human cells currently. </p><p>Now this is looking zooming in on this structure so here is the normal the end of the Syngap gene. We have three exons shown here this makes - these combine to make the SynGAP protein but we found that there are two antisense forms that antisense non-coding RNA and remember they're going the opposite direction and they overlap with exon 17 and exon 16. So this antisense will bind to the sense strand and as I mentioned in many cases these antisense when they bind, they lead to degradation of the RNA. </p><p>So to test this we actually just, since we couldn't do this in mice, we tested it in human cells. These are not neurons but we - called human embryonic kidney cells and what we could do is sort of reconstitute a system to see the impact of this antisense strand on SynGAP. So we we you can put in Syngap gene shown here and you can see the SynGAP is highly expressed (this is the protein) and if we titrate in this antisense strand shown here you see that the SynGAP expression goes down.<br>Using two different antibodies shown here. So this confirms what we we hypothesized: that this anti-sense strand actually inhibits SynGAP function, SynGAP expression. So the twist we we decided to do is to take anti-sense oligos and not target them to SynGAP because that would decrease SynGAP, but target them to the anti-sense strand. So if the anti-sense oligos, the ASOs would down regulate SynGAP the anti-sense strands bringing this level of the antisense down, we could increase SynGAP expression as shown here. </p><p>So we designed a variety of antisense oligos against the antisense strand. I know this is sort of a double negative that's hard to say, let alone understand but using these antisense oligos we try to target this antisense strand to decrease its expression and that would therefore increase the expressions of normal SynGAP.<br>So we screened a variety of these and using first shRNA techniques but then making synthetic ASOs the small antisense oligos and you can see a few of these will target the SynGAP antisense strand. So this is the non-coding Syngap antisense here you can see the expression is very high. If you add in oligo number five it decreases the expression of SynGAP antisense \"syngap2\" and here again if we use a the small oligonucleotide based on the sequence of number five you can see it again it decreases the expression of \"syngap2\".</p><p>Now the the proof in the pudding though is will this regulate SynGAP protein level? And so here what we've done again is reconstitute everything. We put in a Syngap gene, Syngap itself and we add also a Syngap antisense and then and so we get a very low level of expression because the antisense strand is knocking down SynGAP but when we start adding our ASOs you can see that we rescue the expression of the SynGAP protein. So this is saying that knocking down the SynGAP antisense construct is regulating the sense strand the SynGAP expression from the sense RNA.</p><p>So we're continuing that work and trying to look at that in human iPS cells and studying which ones will work best in human system and and that that work is ongoing and I can hopefully give you an update next year. So I want to turn to isoforms of SynGAP and so here is the gene structure of Syngap. This is sort of the most common form that's been studied over the years called the alpha-1 form. There's different splicing here and I'm not going to go into it in detail but some of these exons are for example, not expressed in brain.</p><p>This is exon 11 and this you may know this is so-called \"poison exon\". Stoke is also using ASOs against this region to try to increase expression of SynGAP and we can talk about that at the end if you want. But there are also other isoforms as I'll show you in a second. Some other exons are only found in brains so such as this alpha-1 form and some are suppressed expression in brain tissue.</p><p>So this is where it gets complicated (more complicated) and this is the sort of core structure of SynGAP. This is the core domain this is found in all of the SynGAP isoforms but there are two areas of variation. One is in the n-terminus region and this is because there are alternative start sites so the gene starts at three different places but importantly down here there's a lot of alternative splicing on the c terminal region. There are at least four isoforms: alpha-1, alpha-2, beta, and gamma and they have distinct structures. They have distinct structures that they see terminus that lead to distinct functions and I can go into this if people are interested but recently we and others have started characterizing this. Gavin and I have been working in parallel complementary methods to look at the function of these different isoforms and we wanted to know which one of these isoforms is really important for a SynGAP function in the brain and specifically in SynGAP function in that synaptic plasticity that I talked about earlier. So this is a recent paper (I'm not going to go into it in detail) we had characterizing the different isoforms. Where are these isoforms expressed and when do they get expressed? Where do they get targeted? And what we found is that the alpha-1 isoform is the most critical we think for synaptic plasticity and is the most synaptically targeted isoform.</p><p>So SYNGAP1 alpha-1 goes to synapses very efficiently and is really key for plasticity. And if you just focus down here what I'll just go through this simply is that remember I told you that during LTP induction during plasticity the synapse gets larger. So here you can see this is just in a wild type neuron in culture that's such as a wild type mouse. If you induce LTP you see the the increase in volume. Now if you knock down SynGAP, so if you decrease the level of SynGAP using shRNA techniques, you can see this volume goes up. As I mentioned earlier the size of the spine is already large and in fact when you try to induce plasticity nothing happens. Now what we're going to do is we're going to do what's called a molecular rescue and so we can actually transfect into these neurons a normal SynGAP the normal alpha-1 SynGAP, and you can see you rescue sort of the behavior of the wild-type mouse. So here you're getting expression of the alpha-1. This spine size gets smaller again and then it responds to LTP induction. So with alpha one when we rescue the knockdown of SynGAP without the one we get a nice response, however when we rescue with the other isoforms alpha 2, beta and gamma we don't rescue as well this plasticity. So you see the volume stays, the spine sizes stays up, and again you don't get much of a response during plasticity. So this is, we think, an important result because it certainly says that a key form of SynGAP, potentially for AAV rescue, is the alpha one isoform and I think this agrees with recent unpublished data from from Gavin's lab as well that the alpha-1 isoform is really key for plasticity and behavior in mice.</p><p>So I'm going to stop there. I know it's been a mouthful and hopefully I can clarify things if you have questions but I just want to acknowledge the people involved. So this all started back with Jee-Hae Kim who was a graduate student in the laboratory in 1998. She cloned, as part of her thesis, SynGAP. She now works at Regeneron.<br>Hey Kyoung Lee did the physiology on the knockout back in the early 2000s. She's actually now a faculty in my department, Johns Hopkins she was a postdoctoral fellow. Kogo Takamiya made the knockouts, knocked out in the mouse back in the 2000's he's now a professor in Japan. Gavin Rumbaugh, as many of you know, was a postdoc in my laboratory and worked on the SynGAP as well as other things in the laboratory and of course now he's become a major contributor to the field and I'm very proud of him and he's working in the Scripps institute and he and I and Jimmy Holder constantly are interacting and collaborating and sharing information and reagents etcetera. Sarah Ju actually was an undergraduate student she's now at Oxford university. And this is the SynGAP team shown here in yellow. We have several different people doing different aspects of SynGAP and this is the rest of the lab who are doing other interesting work at least i think so. And again i want to call out Minji Zhang's laboratory who we worked on this together for collaboration for the the structural work and then finally funding NINDS NINH and NIA and I also want to thank SynGAP Research Fund for funding our work as well it's really you know, research takes a lot of time a lot of effort these students and postdocs work night and day and it you know it's not free. It takes generating these mice and even maintaining the mice is an incredibly expensive endeavor and so I just wanna now I'm ready to to sort of have a discussion about potential therapies and be happy to start a discussion with talking about ASOs versus small molecules and viral rescue but I think we can probably take down... stop sharing and we can just begin a discussion.</p><p>Mike: So Rick thanks for that. It was a tour de force and I'm sure parents will watch that a lot and email both of us lots of questions. In the Q&amp;A Dr Hans Schlecht who is a Syngap parent and leads a team of Syngap parents who are MDs and PhDs has been hitting you with four different questions and generally with these webinars we have a few we have a good number of parents join and then we have a lot of parents watch the videos later there's also a lot of scientists on here who I think are going to come in swinging with great questions and they're welcome and we we love seeing scientists interested in Syngap. But I just want to hit you with the hardest question first: you've got some very promising data on your ASO for syngap2 and at the end of the day parents are blown away with the science and glad for the decades of work you've done and they just want to know when that's going to be in the clinic. And as I think about it the question behind that question is like<br>how fast could that be in the clinic are you partnering these I'm gonna they're it's already coming to my inbox how fast it's gonna be the clinic? Are you already working with the drug company? What's the game plan? I just want to get that one out of the way before we let people get now...</p><p>Dr Huganir: So I think we'll talk about the different approaches. I think people are very excited the ASOs because they're pretty, you know, they've been successful in other diseases. They're, you know, the path is relatively clear and straightforward but the key is to find the right antisense oligos that's going to regulate expression and so you know I think there are many biotech companies looking at this. Certainly Stoke is the most you know publicly involved in developing antisense oligos and so I think that they are in the lead I would guess. They, you know, they've taken an approach to increase the expression of of SynGAP by increasing the efficiency of splicing of Syngap in general and also this recent, they had a recent paper looking at this poison exon, exon 11, what we called exon 11. Targeting that to to try to increase SynGAP expression. So we were working on that as well and there are several other labs across the country working both on that that exon and other antisense oligo approaches so I think, you know, the ASOs are probably going to be the first approach you know I'm not Stoke may be the first one to you know get to the point for clinical trials. So you have to, you know, identify the antisense oligo that works in in vitro, you know, in tissue culture or human iPS cells then, you know, in some cases you can show that that rescues in a mouse model for example but then you've got to do the human studies and you know obviously I'm not going to be doing that I have to partner with with pharma or or biotech and so I'm working with a couple biotechs to think about this various approaches and you know I think they're, as as you know, there are lots of biotechs that are thinking about Syngap. Syngap is a very attractive, you know, the syndrome is very attractive to I think pharma because it's a really, you know, one of the most abundant causes of intellectual disability and so if we could rescue the expression of SynGAP it I think would be one of the first cases where we're rescuing a sort of a cognitive disorder you know with Spinal Muscular Atrophy it's really a neurodegeneration you know it's a neuromuscular disease it doesn't affect so much cognition but Syngap would be a great example where you can impact cognitive function and behavior. So I think ASOs are probably gonna be the fastest approach and as you know that takes three to five years once you get a good antisense oligo and you know it's not clear to me where any of these biotech companies are, you know, how close Stoke is to generating those ASOs that they think are clinically important but also whether you know they've taken it on as a major... their next major project. Obviously they're very involved in Dravet Syndrome right now. Okay so we don't know if the Syngap the anti-sense to Syngap2 is gonna work yet and but that's something we're continuing to do. </p><p>Mike: Yeah I got it. There's a been there's a few questions piling in Hans has some scientific ones. James asked about small molecule versus ASOs. I want to just ask you one more I want to just abuse my position to ask you one more question that has come up a few times among different patient groups. Some people have come to us and said why aren't we talking more about AAVs and I am over my skis using any of these terms but basically what I've said to them parroting what I've heard from another rare disease group is as a haploinsufficiency we have a bad a good copy and a bad copy. We're very fortunate to have a good copy so let's use it more and that's basically what ASOs are doing right, taking down the take down you're up regularly. Whereas with an AAV you're going in, it's one it's one shot on goal it's riskier, we're not there yet, and so when people ask me why aren't we pushing harder on that i say i later we're not there yet. Please correct or amend me Professor I mean how do I respond to that question better?</p><p>Dr Huganir: So the, you know, the good thing about ASOs is the it's pretty the path forward is relatively straightforward you know. As you know, the bad part is it's not a cure, right? It's pretty invasive. You inject, you know, into the spinal cord (the ASO) and it distributes it through the spinal cord into the brain and that has to be done on a relatively regular basis. It's also very expensive, of course. So AAVs are a different approach and I think that there's going to be a revolution in AAVs. There are whole biotech companies that are only working on AAVs, developing AAVs that will target the brain well and so I think there's going to be progress both in academics and in the biotech world. So one problem with AAVs currently you can only package a certain size of a gene in there that they have a limit on the size of the gene but I think that there's progress in developing better load, you know, loads for the for AAVs. We think we can probably package Syngap in the AAV because we've been developing some AAVs that can handle something as large as Syngap. But I think the key here is which isoforms? So you can't express the whole gene. The gene is humongous. You really have to express just one of the isoforms and so if you can only deliver one of the isoforms, which one? And will just one isoform rescue the, you know, behaviors? So our bet would be to try alpha-1 because we think that's the most important. I think Gavin is taking some approaches to see at the mouse level which isoforms are the most important for for behavior or rescuing the haploinsufficiency. So I think that's that's the key problem is to which one to package. And then also AAV, you know, this techniques for therapies is not quite there yet. There's been a couple approved as you know, SMN has been there is an AAV that's been approved and so it'll be really interesting to see how those clinical trials go.</p><p>Mike: Great, thank you. So you can read probably 10 times as fast as I can. Do you want to just tear through the Q&amp;A and knock some of these out? What do you want? <br>Dr Huganir: yeah so Hans, hi Hans, so immune effects ASOs for example plasma based pam triggering I'm not sure I don't know enough about that. One thing about antisense oligos in this case will be injecting them into the into the brain right, so they would be either in the spinal cord into the ventricular system and so they might be protected against antibody responses but I'm not sure more about that.</p><p>Dr Hans Schlecht: Do you think meaningful insights into the kids can be made from studying C. elegans and get ortholog? Is C. elegans used as a model organism for any similar diseases? Thanks so much.</p><p>Dr Huganir: Yeah see it I mean C. elegans has been a, you know, an amazing system for years and, you know, many genes found in lots of diseases were initially studied and identified in C. elegans so definitely I think that C. elegans can be a very useful system. It's a lot of Cryo-EM work on GLUT and AMPA receptors lately is there work being done to look at the fine structure of SynGAP, including the missense variants in an effort to do structural function studies. We're not doing Cryo-EM on on SynGAP we are, Hopkins has just recruited a young Cryo-EM person so maybe we might be able to do that. You know, the missense variants, I really think that they may be unstable so it'd be hard to pick which one to study, which one really gets expressed in kids and is not degraded by, you know, protein instability.</p><p>Okay the HGNC but I need more information about that Hans, I don't know what you're referring to. Transportation system to deliver and have a good distribution of ASOs any progress? I think people are there's lots of progress lots of work going on in that area both using modifying different ASOs a variety of different ways. There's delivering them with AAVs for example, there's one possibility.</p><p>Okay go down to Neil...Is the assumption that synaptic plasticity could also reflect learning improvement plasticity? Yes. So that's what we would hope and this comes to the you know the burning issue is when do you treat? When you do you treat early? And if you treat late can you still rescue some phenotypes? And if you saw Gavin's talk you know he is clear that you can rescue some phenotypes in a real, in an adult mouse and so that gives hope that treatments can have impacts even later in life but of course we really want to treat as early as possible and so in theory you know we know Syngap's involved in learning memory but those mechanisms are also involved in development of the nervous system so, you know, there are windows of time when SynGAP is critical and the reversibility of that is not clear so so during wiring of the brain SynGAP is important. If you rescue after that will you be able to rescue the behaviors? It's not clear.</p><p>Dr Huganir: Is the research assumption that synaptic plasticity could reflect learning plasticity? Yes.</p><p>Dr Huganir: What are the most promising areas for small molecules? So this is what I'm most excited about... hey there Tony... &nbsp;is, you know, there are now small molecules that affect splicing. So for SMN there's a small molecule that was isolated through high throughput screening and so you don't have to use an ASO anymore you could use a small molecule to do the same thing that ASO was doing to increase the expression of the protein and so I think doing high through throughput screens to try to regulate splicing of Syngap with small molecules is really a productive way to go. Yes, in the best of all worlds they would be orally available, you would take a pill and you would have to be on on those pills for life but, you know, hopefully with not serious off-target effects. I think there's great potential for small molecules. Now we didn't talk about this too much but you know there are many ways to regulate SynGAP expression and I didn't go into to all of them but, you know, with Gavin he went his talk he discussed some of these, you know, you can regulate expression, you can regulate degradation of the protein. There are many different ways and so we understood more about the sort of the metabolism the life path of SynGAP, you know, what regulates its expression, stability of the protein and the RNA, and also the degradation, we could target those pathways with small molecules as well. The other approach that we initially took, some of you may know this, is to try to inhibit or regulate downstream signaling from Syngap using small molecules and this could be effective but we found at least in our studies we were having trouble getting that to work in vivo and intact animals. I won't go into detail about that but but again those are not cures there you know it would just be therapeutic would take every day and many cases they might have side effects.</p><p>Yeah i think small molecules would be better than ASOs if we for example the small molecule that we're regularly splicing would be better as long as the side effects that is less intrusive.</p><p>Dr Huganir: All right so Olga says which are the more severe Syngap mutations? Are they identified based on type missense, nonsense versus strictly based on patient phenotype So if you just look at the Syngap mutations the the most severe are the ones that you would predict disrupt SynGAP expression or function and so the nonsense mutations in many cases lead to nonsense mediated decay of the RNA so basically the RNA is totally gone and you get 50% of SynGAP expression. So those are severe. Some of those are more severe than others they have frame shifts and then truncations. Missense mutations as you may know is it's just a change of a single amino acid so it just changes an amino acid from one to another in some cases that can be very mild that can be have no effect on SynGAP function and that's those are commonly found in many genes in the sense mutations that produce variations in protein sequence and have no impact but the ones that lead to disease that where there's you know very clear genetics that that missense mutation is causing intellectual disability we really frankly don't know why you know and I think Gavin talked about this as well it could be that protein is expressed but it's not working well or it's as I said it's the protein to express but it's very unstable and so it gets degraded very rapidly the question of phenotype genotype so looking at the genotype and and how that impacts the phenotype the behaviors of the severity of the behaviors with your children is really not clear yet and I think that's something that all the geneticists are trying to look at now is there a correlation between phenotype and genotype you know as many of you know there are many other genes although they're they're not causal for the Syngap Syndrome but they may impact the severity of the syndrome so so the background genetics of the individual may make them more or less susceptible to Syngap mutations okay i don't know if i can answer all of these mics if you want to</p><p>Mike: i'm sorry i'm sorry I realized i'm putting on a spot there there were only a few and then people have piled on so jess duggan's question though is interesting right I may have missed this but increasing expression of syngap rescue have any impact on neurons structure itself or is it SynGAP rescued?</p><p>Dr Huganir: Yeah, so we and other people have seen this, Gavin's seen this, that there is some effect on in the knockouts of structure, the dendritic structure in particular there's a delay in, sort of, the development of the dendrites and we find that's actually affected we think more by the beta isoform than the alpha-1 isoform and so this is one complication of, you know, the AAV. If we rescue with the alpha-1 and not with the beta will that, you know, not rescue the plasticity but it won't rescue dendritic development. So this is where it gets more complicated but definitely yeah there are effects of SynGAP on sort of the development of and the elaboration of dendrites as well as the size of synapses as i mentioned as well.</p><p>Mike: So Jess has another good question but i want to just follow up on that. So if you go with an AAV you have to pick an isoform and so you go with the alpha and you have the good news but you don't have the beta but if you go with an ASO and you take down you go take down syngap2, you take off a regulatory mechanism you're then not this is a question but i'm stating it as a fact you can correct me you're then not wading into isoforms right so the you you're leaving the existing mechanisms to determine which isoform to create is that is that then arguably...?</p><p>Dr Huganir: Right so there's two ways, you know, there's there's splice switching oligonucleotides and then there's antisense oligonucleotides and so one approach is... the safest approach is to regulate the expression of all isoforms, right. So to upregulate all isoforms and then the normal regulatory mechanisms will produce the normal ratio of all isoforms. Another... but you can develop antisense oligos or splice switching oligos that will for say example increases the levels of splicing of the alpha-1 isoform to produce more of that relative to the other isoforms and that may have a therapeutic effect, right, but<br>if the beta form for example is very critical that may not get you where you want to be. So I think these are things we have to study and these things these can be studied in mice and that's what you know Gavin is doing.</p><p>Mike: Right I want to ask one more. There was a question about do we know how much SynGAP you'd have to add back? So this I'm going to ask you about SynGAP level. I'm going to nest three questions here. One question was how much SynGAP you have to have back to to stop seizures? I can't wait to hear your answer to that one. The other question is and following on to that like some mosaic children don't have seizures and there's this idea that's starting to circulate where because we have some mosaic patients right and we were we had a family meeting the other night and someone's like well does that mean if we treat our kids with an ASO and we upregulate SynGAP but not all the way... are the mosaic kids in our community today what our kids could look like after that ASO and I thought that was an interesting quote. I want to take it a step further: what happens if we, and you haven't touched on this, what happens if we go over 100% are we closer to understanding that question? And that brings us to titration as one of the merits of ASOs because we can babystep right so they just threw four things at you.</p><p>Dr Huganir: So we've been trying to do that. Yoichi who you know, has been trying to titrate up and see where it gets. What level it gets rescued. I don't think we have to go too forward. I don't think we'd have to go to 100%, at least in our model systems, you know, I think it's more close to you know 150% or 50% you know, back up to 25% up to 75% of wild type. So I think, you know, we might get away with less. Now the mosaics are very different though, those are, you know, those are different cells, right. So there you have different, you know, population of cells that are missing SynGAP, I would presume, and then with the ASO treatment you're up regulating all the SynGAP, you know, in theory in all cells and so it's a very different, you know, end point. In one case you have a mixture of wild type and mutant cells and the other you're just you're increasing the, you know, the levels of SynGAP in all cells.</p><p>Mike: Great. So I think we actually have gotten through most of the questions. I just i'm going to read James Clements last because I think it speaks to rescue which of course all of us who have kids are obsessed with right? Time is brain. So you mentioned we don't know what the critical periods are and I think if memory serves, Gavin's written a paper saying \"this is the developmental period\" and then he wrote another much happier paper like \"hey, we rescued something!\" So James's question is: do we know whether ASOs leads to restoring rewiring of neuronal connections to wild type level particularly after critical period? My question is,<br>I'll let you answer that one then I'll give you a following.</p><p>Dr Huganir: Yeah, we don't know. I think there are several people doing this now in mouse models. I haven't seen any talks on it. So what you would do is, you know, do the ASO treatments and in mouse models like it's been done with SMN and other, you know, in the early pre-clinical studies and you could do it at different time points, for example. The key here is you need to have ASOs that will target the mouse sequences, not the human sequences and do it in that direction and so for example with the antisense construct which is not in mice we can't test our ASOs in mice. So James I don't know. Somebody may know the answer to that. I don't think anybody's that far yet. I know stoke is probably trying this probably as we speak, I would guess but that's, you know, a big question is you know, if we treat later and certain periods of development have already, you know, passed, whether it's, you know, three, four, five, six, seven or ten years old, you know, are we gonna be able to rescue the important critical developmental periods, developmental plasticity that occurs during those times? You know, Gavin's results suggest that several of the phenotypes including the seizures can be rescued later in life so I think there's hope.</p><p>Mike: Wonderful. Thank you. I don't see any other -<br>JJ. JJ started typing now, look out. If you go to the - and I'll let have the last word and then I'll thank you so much for this incredible presentation but if you go to the bottom, JJ has two questions: What are the ripple effects of the abnormal structure of the synapse?</p><p>Dr Huganir: So the synapse, and this changes during development, you know, Gavin has looked at this but having these large, very active synapses means that they're very excitable and so that might underlie the epilepsy and the seizures. We don't know that but certainly that would make sense that these large synapses make the neurons more excitable and that leads to seizures. But also they're sort of locked in and they're sort of reached their largest size they can get so there's no plasticity they can't, you know, they can't rewire during learning. So when you learn something, as I mentioned, this plasticity takes over, you make new connections like the synapses get larger and that, you know, encodes the memory, for example. If they're already large you can't modify them and so you can't... that sort of... you lose that ability to become a plastic synapse. <br>Mike: And what about artificial transcription factors to upregulate the gene?</p><p>Dr Huganir: So a lot of, there's a lot of interest in regulating SynGAP function expression studying transcription factors promoters, you know, we heard a great talk about epigenetics, studying epigenetic regulation of SynGAP expression. There's not a lot known about, you know, the transcription factors involved. We can guess which ones may be involved. The problem with artificial transcription factors is that transcription factors in general regulate many different genes so so putting transcription factors in there to regulate SynGAP will probably regulate many other other genes as well and that would produce off-target effects that could be detrimental.</p><p>Mike: Okay she's kept going: so if we can correct SynGAP protein to wild type can this abnormal architecture be<br>corrected? It will correct the abnormal architecture in the cell, right. But the question is whether the circuit that was formed during development, whether you can you can correct that. So that's the big question and, you know, most of who would say probably not and that's, you know, the major concern in treating later than rather than earlier.</p><p>Mike: Right. Amazing. Well, thank you.</p><p>Dr Huganir: There's a lot of work we still have to do so... yeah looking forward to... With COVID, you know, I can only have 50% of the people in the lab at a time but they're working night and day. We have two to three shifts and, you know, they're working through the through the night to get the work done, so.</p><p>Mike: Appreciate it. Thank you very much Rick. This has been an epic webinar and we appreciate an hour and a half your time. All right. It's been an honor pleasure I'll see you again somewhere soon I'm sure and maybe not in person but yeah, yeah on a screen for sure in person... God only knows. Not telling. All right, thank you Rick. Thank you very much.<br></p>",

The goal of the series is to get&nbsp; you closer to the science, making you aware of the&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>research that is being done and the opportunities&nbsp;to participate, and empowering your communications&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>with clinicians. </p><p>We also want to remind you of our&nbsp;next webinar in the series with Dr. Marcelo Coba on&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>November 5th at 12 pacific time on \"How and why&nbsp; to use human cells models to study Syngap\".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h2>Transcript:</h2><p>Today's talk is \"SYNGAP1: The road from gene discovery to target therapy\" by Dr. Heather Mefford. Dr. Mefford is an assistant professor of pediatric and at the University of Washington in the division of genetic medicine and attending physician at Seattle Children's Hospital in the genetic medicine clinic. Dr. Mefford's research laboratory is devoted to the discovery of novel genetic and genomic causes of pediatric disease. A major focus of the current work is to identify causes of pediatric epilepsy by employing whole exome sequencing, target gene panel sequencing, and custom array comparative genomic hybridization. She helps to create better diagnostic tools and treatments for patients who have health conditions with underlying genetic causes. The Mefford lab has discovered numerous new epilepsy genes. Dr Mefford has also been involved in the discovery and characterization of several new genomic disorders her clinical interests parallel her research interests and include seeing patients with genomic disorders and patients with severe epilepsy and neurocognitive defects of unknown etiology Dr Mefford relies on precision medicine to provide the most useful treatment options for patients and their families.</p><p>Dr Mefford:&nbsp;Great, thank you&nbsp;Marta, that was wonderful. It's great to be here today and I'm happy to give you kind of a a little bit of a whirlwind tour about genetic&nbsp;epilepsies in general, so how do we find genetic causes of disease which has been the focus of&nbsp;my group for about the past 10 years and then I'll focus on kind of what we know about SYNGAP1 and how that was identified what we know about the mutations and then give just a general overview at the end of emerging new therapies which hopefully some of them will apply to SYNGAP1 in the near future perhaps not all but I want to just give you kind of an introduction into the types of therapies that are under investigation by lots of different groups not necessarily mine but I know just enough to hopefully answer some of your questions about that and I'll just get started maybe there we go. </p><p>So as I said my lab is really dedicated to gene discovery and pediatric disease so we're not purely a SYNGAP1 laboratory we're more interested in identifying genetic causes of pediatric disease because we believe that it will be useful in identifying mutations in affected individuals mostly children and the disorders that we study and that we and others can work once we understand those genetic causes to understand the underlying biology the pathways the places that we could intervene to develop new therapies and improve the lives of affected individuals and what I like about the work that we do is that for the most part when we identify novel causes of disease, genetic causes of disease, this goes actually directly back to the clinical setting and gets incorporated into the test that probably for the parents on the call probably many of your children have a genetic test that included SYNGAP1 and every probably every month or so there are new genes added to these tests because of the discoveries that are being made at a rapid pace which I'll show you in a minute. As a geneticist I like to think about, you know, why do we care about getting a genetic diagnosis and I have to make this argument to insurance companies more often than I'd like but I think, you know, understanding of genetic diagnosis in a in any disease helps us on the clinical side give better counseling to families about prognosis. So what my life or my child's life going to look like? It helps us discuss recurrence risk which is, you know, will this happen again in my family? Either my immediate family or extended family? And in the case of epilepsy, among other disorders, it can affect the choice of medications, which we'll talk about towards the end, and provides research opportunities. Once you have a genetic diagnosis you can find those investigators working specifically on that gene disease or pathway and get involved and importantly it connects families with the same genetic diagnosis. That should be no secret here as SRF is a great example of this but there are many and I think over the past 10 years the emergence of family support groups and foundations and research funds through digital connections that's been one of the biggest advances that I've seen outside of just the basic science. And then of course the other reason that we do this is that we hope that understanding the genetic etiology will push us towards developing new and better precise therapies because it gives us specific targets to go after.&nbsp;</p><p>So this is an early view of what the genetics of epilepsy looked like 10 years ago or more and I'm just showing you kind of a very general discovery curve I guess. The first gene for any type of epilepsy was identified in 1995 and then there was this slow and steady uptick in genes identified with various types of epilepsy and the red circles here are more severe pediatric epileptic encephalopathies. And these were all, every one was a significant advance in understanding genetic causes of epilepsy. But we kind of plateaued and it was around between 2005 and 2009 that some new technologies were introduced into the field of genetics and genomics and we decided to apply these technologies to understand epilepsy and with the goal being again let's understand the genetic underlying genetic causes of... (I'll explain the \"EE\" in a minute) developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, with the goal to improve diagnosis in the clinics, genetic counseling, and eventually treatment. So I'm going to take a quick step back. For some of you this will be very basic but I want to make sure that those of you who aren't geneticists understand how we do this. So thinking about how do we improve our understanding of the genetics of epilepsy? Well we go after the genes, right, and because we're going to be talking about genomes, genes and DNA and genes I'll remind everybody that when I talk about the human genome that's really all of the DNA. So every single cell in our bodies carries 23 pairs of chromosomes, those little XS here which are packages of DNA and you can think about this as kind of the full instruction set or information set for building and maintaining our bodies. Each chromosome is a packet of DNA really&nbsp;and you can think of that as one volume of the encyclopedia. And on each of those chromosomes resides a number of genes which are the basic construction units and they're kind of scattered across the chromosomes.</p><p>So not all DNA encodes a gene and if you think about it if our encyclopedia analogy are these readable sentences here in red among other DNA sequence that is not as easy to interpret and we'll get back to that a little bit. So think of them as short sentences or short paragraphs that provide the actual instructions for making proteins and again building all the all the parts of our body. So humans have 20,000 approximately individual genes. In each of those genes is a code to make a protein and we can read that code. And the ability to read that code is important because that's how we know when the code is messed up and provides incomplete or incorrect instructions. And so you can think of that as a spelling error or \"typo\" which can happen when we copy DNA. Our bodies are very good at copying DNA but there's so&nbsp;much of it. Three billion individual letters and so there are always mistakes that are made when we&nbsp;copy DNA. Most of them don't have a noticeable impact on our health or development though. So&nbsp;you can think of it like changing one letter in a sentence so if you change a single letter it can significantly change the meaning of that sentence. Or it can have a very subtle impact or no impact on the meaning of that sentence. So this is an example here of sitting in the context of the gene for sickle cell disease and again one single letter among thousands causes a change in the sickle cell gene that results in sickle cell anemia. So these types of genetic changes, which you can think of as spelling errors are the&nbsp;missense, what we refer to as missense changes, but importantly you can also have genetic changes that just stop. Basically stop reading, right. These are, we refer to them as premature truncations, nonsense, or stop mutations and these are the types of mutations that are actually very important in Syngap. The other types of mutations you might hear about all have the same, usually have the same effect of prematurely truncating the protein include frame shift variants and splice variants.<br> Splice variants are important because genes are not actually just a single readable sentence in our genome and they're broken up. And so you can think of sort of each of these exons as one of the words in the sentence that need to be sliced together and that splicing machinery takes out the intervening sequence and puts the puts the gene together in a way that encodes the protein and this is the code that we actually read. So if you mess up splicing, for example you might not include this middle exon and then again it takes out a chunk of sentence and it causes an error.</p><p>So how do we find these sequencing errors? Well we read the DNA and for a long time we had a very robust (but slow) sequencing method. This is a traditional method. The actual output is shown here on screen by these red, green, blue, and black traces here that read the DNA. And it was in about two thousand, I don't know 2008, 2009, where we finally developed a new (not me but some brilliant people) developed a new sequencing technology so \"Next Generation Sequencing\" or \"high throughput sequencing\" where we could actually do this much, much, much more quickly, much more cheaply and sequence lots of DNA in a short period of time. And just to give you a sense for what an impact this has had on this field of gene discovery in human genetics: we sequenced the first human genome so this is the Human Genome Project using this first technology in about 10 years for 3 billion dollars and today using Next Generation Sequencing I could sequence the genomes of everyone on this call in a matter of a few days for a thousand dollars each or less. It costs a little more to actually and takes a little longer to interpret all of that information but this has had an incredible impact on gene discovery. And so our group has used these technologies to study specifically the severe early onset epilepsies also known as Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies and other related neurodevelopmental disorders. And as you all probably know these are fairly severe conditions where often kids will have seizures in the first days, weeks or years of life and they'll have associated developmental delays and sometimes poor outcomes and this can be developmental outcomes or health outcomes but it has a significant impact on quality of life. Individually there are many different types of Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies both from kind of how they present from a clinical standpoint but also from the genetic etiology and each individual DEE is rare but collectively they start to add up and they're actually more common than you would think.</p><p>The seizures are often intractable in these disorders and despite all of the medications at our disposal which is over 40 anti-epileptic drugs today, many of them are not effective even in combination for these kids, speaking to the need for more precise therapies. So we have over the years collected over a thousand kids with a DEE presentation, so severe early onset epilepsies and developmental delays and by \"we\" I mean not just my group but we collaborate with some wonderful researchers in Melbourne Australia, Ingrid Scheffer who many of you have probably heard of, with our collaborators locally and regionally as well as people that we meet across across the internet at meetings with people across the world who refer patients to us. And then we use the sequencing technology to look for the genetic cause in those individuals and we can do this in very similar ways to the clinical tests that are available today. So we often start by a gene panel. So sequencing 10 genes or 50 genes or 100 genes at a time or we can sequence all 20,000 genes which is exome sequencing and we've used both approaches for different reasons at different times and I can answer questions about that afterwards if you like.</p><p>So I think it's important to understand also how do we... we find genetic changes in everyone so every individual has differences in their DNA compared to the person sitting next to them and how do we decide if that genetic change is disease-causing? Especially when we're identifying new disease genes. And these are some of the criteria that we use and I can get into the nitty-gritty later if anyone's interested, but basically the genetic changes that we see in things like Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies we don't usually see in healthy people and we have public databases available now that provide information about whether specific genetic changes are seen in the population. As I said, we can read the code for every one of these genes and so we want to know that the gene is predicted to impact the protein, so have a damaging impact on proteins and there are different ways that we can discern that. When we're looking for new genetic causes of disease we like to see that multiple individuals with the same disease have changes in the same gene and then when we're talking about DEE, as many of you know, these changes are often new in the affected child compared to their parents and that's just shown here in this what we call parent-child trio where there's a genetic change here in the child that's not present in either parent. And importantly every single one of us again has these types of changes that are new compared to those changes that we inherit from our parents so we have to take those new changes in context of all the other things that I've shown here on this slide again to determine that it's disease causing.</p><p>So using this approach our group and many others who've taken similar approaches has greatly has greatly impacted gene discovery over the past 10 years and I'm showing you here just a subset of the genes that have been identified to cause Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies many of which are quite similar phenotypically to SYNGAP1-related disease and there are well over 70 probably 100 new genes identified (they're not all listed here) and Mike pointed out to me that SYNGAP1 is not on this list but I added it and importantly I think it's remarkable to realize that SYNGAP1 variants were one of the first kind of \"new genes\" identified and it was first reported related to human disease in 2009. And the first reports were not really focused on epilepsy. They were focused on the intellectual disability aspect and a lot of the early research in gene discovery in pediatric disease was intellectual disability. So this is the paper in 2009 that first reported mutations in SYNGAP1 and they sequenced 94 individuals with intellectual disability and found three who had a de novo truncating variant. They also sequenced some kids with autism, some individuals with schizophrenia, and 190 unaffected individuals for SYNGAP1 and found none of them to have variants in the SYNGAP1 gene. </p><p>So this was the first report and over the next&nbsp;about three years several additional studies trickled out reporting additional individuals with variants in SYNGAP1 and there were total, when we were starting to think about identifying causes of epilepsy, there were a total of about 18 patients who had been reported including the three in this first paper and we noticed that at least 12 of those were reported to have epilepsy in addition to their intellectual disabilities. And so we took the approach of saying well, we want to know what if we sequence a bunch of individuals who come into the clinic with a primary complaint of epilepsy who may also have developmental disorders or developmental delays. And so that's what we did and reported in 2013, was sequencing 500 individuals with an epileptic encephalopathy and here we took a gene panel approach. So we sequenced 65 genes. About half of those were known genes so already associated with epilepsy or proposed to be intellectual disability genes or autism genes and then the other half were genes that were not yet associated with disease and so we were testing the hypothesis that they would be a cause of epileptic encephalopathy. And so CHD2 at the time was not associated with any human disorder and we identified mutations in this gene and showed that it was a cause of DE but we also found mutations in SYNGAP1 as one of the most frequently mutated genes in our cohort as well and this was work that was led by my postdoc at the time Gemma Carvill and with important obviously contribution of patients from our collaborators in Australia. So this was what we reported at the time. There were again 500 patients that we sequenced and the bars in blue were genes that were already known to be DEE genes and so we found lots of variants in SCN1A, CDKL5, STXBP1 and then CHD2 and SYNGAP1 were the next most commonly changed genes and we found five individuals with de novo truncating variants in SYNGAP1 and concluded that this was a cause of not just intellectual disability but also could be even more severe Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy. So this is a diagram of the SYNGAP1 gene. This is also from this paper and the variants in red here are the ones that we identified and all of them are truncating variants. The variants in black were previously reported in the literature and those in bold all have epilepsy in addition to their developmental delays and intellectual disability and those that are not bolded did not have seizures.</p><p>So more recently this is work led by Ingrid&nbsp;Scheffer that I'm sure you're all familiar with but they looked at and described 57 individuals&nbsp;most of which had not been previously reported with variants in SYNGAP1 and they described&nbsp;both the genetic landscape as well as really nice detailed phenotype information. And I'm not going to focus on the phenotype today, I'm going to focus on the genetics, but importantly they found that 34 of the variants again were those truncating, so nonsense/stop/frame shift variants, eight of them were splice site variants which usually lead to premature truncation, four were deletions that included SYNGAP1. So one copy of SYNGAP1 was deleted and then only 11 of them were missense and so I think this starts to tell us something about the mechanism- oh sorry, here's a figure from their paper and it's very busy but what you need to know is that this top figure, again this is the gene. These are all the exons in blue and the truncating variants are on the top and then the missense variants are on the bottom and these are patients not in their study but but in the literature, and again truncating variants on the top and missense variants on the bottom and what you can see is that first most of the variants are truncating and second the missense variants tend to fall into these colored domains. Not all of them but most of them and these are regions of the protein that we know to be important for its function. So the thought is that changing one amino acid in those regions may disrupt the function of the protein.</p><p>And I think this is important for thinking about what is the mechanism or why the variants in SYNGAP1 cause disease. We have two copies. These variants occur only in one copy of the gene and the fact that most of them lead to premature truncation, so one of the copies is just not made and not functioning, tells us that it's most likely loss-of-function of the gene or haploinsufficiency. \"Haplo\" being half. So one copy is gone and the other is normal and functioning but the amount of SYNGAP1 that's present is not enough for normal development. So loss of function likely the mechanism. There are lots of nuances to this that we can get into later but we generally think of genetic disorders as due to loss of function of the gene or gain or increased function of the gene which can sometimes be actually a new function of the gene and that does not seem to be the case for SYNGAP1. So as I told you we didn't identify just SYNGAP1 but over the years we've we've found the genetic cause in many of our patients and what's important to remember about neurodevelopmental disorders in general is that there are *many* different genes where a mutation can cause a similar phenotype and here just each bar represents a gene and the height of the bar is the number of patients in our cohort whose genetic cause is due to that gene and these orange bars are the genes where we played a significant role in first reporting variants in those genes associated with disease and then also in reporting kind of genotype/phenotype correlations for some of the newer genes. So if we think go back to why do we do these genetic studies and find genetic causes the reason is it helps us understand the biology so what what different things can go wrong and lead to abnormal development and then now we have specific targets.</p><p>So how do we&nbsp;use this information to develop new therapies that might be more effective and more precise for specific genetic disorders? So how do we do that? Right? The goal is when you get your genetic diagnosis there's information about specific treatments. So this is an area where there is not a specific SYNGAP1 therapy yet but I'm going to tell you about some advances recently in developing new types of therapies but I'm first going to tell you what I guess what what do we know about epilepsy and how precise can we get today so part of the reason I want to talk about the mechanism is it loss or gain of function or what's the pathway is: it matters. For precision therapy that's precisely why we do this and there are some examples of treatment recommendations for specific genetic disorders involving epilepsy and development. So one is GLUT1 deficiency, so SLC2A1 is the gene and this is when you have a mutation in this gene you have trouble transporting glucose or sugars into the brain for energy and so the ketogenic diet helps generate alternative fuels to get into the brain for proper functioning. So if you get a diagnosis of SLC2A1 the recommendation will likely be that you go on the ketogenic diet and it is effective.<br> Another example is an epilepsy due to mutations in this gene here ALDH7A1 and the important thing about this is that it blocks vitamin B6 production and utilization and so the treatment is to go around that blockage and treat the patients with vitamin B6 which stops their seizures. <br>When we think about gain of function and loss of function that also matters. So SCN1A which causes Dravet Syndrome, mutations in SCN1A cause loss of function or haploinsufficiency and SCN1A encodes a sodium channel. So if you're already missing, you don't have enough of the sodium channel, you really don't want to further block sodium channels and some of the drugs that we use for epilepsy are sodium channel blockers. So knowing that you have an SCN1A mutation your neurologist will most likely avoid sodium channel blockers because we know that these can make the disease worse in some individuals. But on the other hand there are two other sodium channel genes where the mutations that cause epilepsy are gain-of-function mutations. So this is a really important distinction because in these individuals the drugs here on the right, which are sodium channel blockers actually can improve disease. Now neither of these are magic bullets for these disorders but they're important because you need to know whether you're going to make the disease better or worse by using this class of drugs.</p><p>So that's great. This is taking information about genetics and using the medications that we have available on the shelf today to our best ability but what are the drugs coming down the pipeline? So I think there's some really really exciting emerging approaches and emerging therapies that I'll tell you about and some of these may very well be effective for SYNGAP1-related disease if we can find the right one. So there are some buzzwords that you may have heard in the literature or in research talks that you've been to. The first is \"antisense oligonucleotide\" or \"ASO\" therapy. So antisense oligonucleotides are really small. There's just 20 bases or so. Single-stranded RNA. So not DNA but RNA molecules and you can use ASOs, they're designed to go in and bind to the RNA. The RNA is the intermediate between DNA and protein and you can use them to bind to the RNA and depending on how you design it you can actually increase expression of that gene, and amount of the protein, or decrease expression of the gene and decrease the amount of protein. You can also affect that splicing mechanism of the gene. So you can go in and block splicing that shouldn't be happening that's happening because of mutation or you can interfere with splicing in a way that might correct splicing changes.</p><p>Gene therapy is another technology that has been around since I started grad school. There was a lot of hope for gene therapy. It's been a lot harder and longer road than I think we ever anticipated to have effective gene therapies across human disorders but there have been advances and there are promising therapies for some disorders and some that are on the market already. And then there are other approaches using RNA approaches to increase or decrease gene expression. The little diagram at the right is something called a SINEUP which you can design. Again it's an RNA molecule that you go in, you design it to bind to your gene of interest, and it increases the amount of protein that's produced from that particular gene. CRISPR I don't even have on this list but obviously that's in the mix as well. Thinking about how to use CRISPR to correct rather than just replace the specific mutations in the gene. And so importantly like I said there have been advances. There are some of these that are already available clinically. Spinal Muscular Atrophy is a very severe fatal disorder that now has great options for therapy. So there's an ASO therapy that is in use right now. Nusinersen is the name you might hear and there's a gene therapy for SMA: Zolgesma which is available for kids I think under the under the age of one of them is under the age of two one of them is even earlier but these have been actually very very effective and life-changing for many kids with SMA and there are probably other examples out there but these are the the two that come to mind as particularly effective. So what about epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders?<br> <br>Well there's great I think promise for these types of therapies as well and the most recent and exciting example is for SCN1A-related disease particularly Dravet syndrome. In this paper we've kind of heard about these studies over the past couple of years but the paper was finally published just in the past month or two and this is an ASO for SCN1A and I'll show you exactly the mechanism in a minute but basically what you need to know is that the ASO results in an increase in SCN1A protein and so in the study of mice with Dravet syndrome when you give the ASO at day of life 2&nbsp;in the mice what you see is basically that it prevents seizures and it prevents the premature death that inevitably affects SCN1A mice. So the purple line here is normal mice who 100% survive out to 90 days because they don't have an SCN1A mutation. The red line are mice with SCN1A mutations who didn't get treated and what you can see is that at about day 20 or so they start to have seizures and usually when once they have a seizure they have sudden death. And you can see that by day 30 about 80 percent of the mice have died. But when you treat mice with this ASO therapy, that's the blue line here, the vast, vast, vast majority do not develop seizures and survive out 90 days just like wild type mice and so this is very exciting. Humans are not mice. So we need to always need to keep that in mind and for most kids with Dravet syndrome we don't diagnose them on day of life two before they've had a seizure. We usually diagnose them because they've had a seizure and so their second study within the same paper treating mice closer to the time they develop seizures and it's still an effective therapy. It doesn't look as pretty as this curve but it's still very, very effective and so thinking about when to treat and how to treat is really important and what effect, what differences in effect, a treatment will have based on the timing is important as well.</p><p>For those who want to know the details, the idea here is that SCN1A actually has an extra exon. This pink exon here is just a cartoon version but it's what we call a \"poison exon\" because when you splice in this exon to the SCN1A gene, it actually introduces a stop. So it's similar to the stop mutations or premature truncation mutations and so the full length protein is not made and this is normal but it's probably normal in cell types where you don't need SCN1A or developmental time points where you don't need SCN1A. So the idea for this ASO is that if we go in and block incorporation of this \"poison exon\" then the cell is more likely to make more of the normal full-length SCN1A and that's exactly what happens. So the ASO goes in, it blocks incorporation of the \"poison exon\" and you have more full-length SCN1A.<br> This ASO therapy is now in clinical trials for patients with Dravet syndrome through a company called Stoke Therapeutics. So it'll be really exciting to see how effective this is in the human population. And they have treated their first patient. I haven't heard any outcomes. I briefly touched on SCN8A-related epilepsy earlier. This is where mutations cause a gain-of-function of the gene. So you make too much of a copy that's not working properly or actually you make a copy that's not working properly and increases the function of a channel in a way that's deleterious and there's a recent publication from a group in Michigan led by Miriam Meisler where they used an ASO to decrease production of the SCN8A protein. This is just the opposite of for SCN1A where they use it to increase production of protein. But here you want to \"knock down\" SCN8A because you have that copy that's hyperactive and so they actually treated mice again who had SCN8A mutation that you can find it's the same mutation found in some humans and causes disease and they found that treating with that ASO increased survival of the mice. It delayed seizure onset and it improved their motor activity. It was not, they had to get, so for the SCN1A ASO they actually just gave a single dose. For the SCN8A ASO they found that giving repeated doses over time was actually more effective than just a single dose. So again learning about how how to treat and how to use these novel therapies in the model organisms is going to be important. Interestingly they also treated mice with mutations in SCN1A not SCN8A but they use the SCN8A ASO and it improved survival in those mice as well. This is a little more complicated story but the reason I bring it up is that sometimes when we develop therapies for one specific genetic cause of a disease it actually may have broader implications for other disorders that are related or that have mutations in a different gene but that's in the same pathway. And so I think it's important to remember that maybe we don't have to develop a therapy for every single gene but that we can work together with within pathways or within disorders and hopefully to have targeted therapies that work more broadly.</p><p>So I'm going to end with thinking about you know the promise of these novel therapies is huge. It's really exciting right now but I think as always we need to be cautious and we need to think about a lot of different possible outcomes and I think for me when I, you know, talk with patients in the clinic about, you know, why can't we just do this? There are lots of things to think about. So again what is the right level of gene expression for a particular gene? So we have these techniques now where we can add a gene back or we can turn up the volume for that gene as a level expression we can turn down the volume but we've got to get it right. So genes like SCN8A, while there are gain-of-function mutations that cause epilepsy, loss-of-function of that gene can also cause movement disorders and intellectual disability. So, you know, we need to be careful about what if we turn it down too much do we actually cause a different disorder? What cell types do we need to get the therapies to and how do we get them there? These are disorders of the brain. The brain is a tough place to get to&nbsp;and, you know, how much do we need to give and how often to get into the right amount of cells to actually have an effect? How specific is the treatment? So again using an SCN8A ASO treated SCN1A mice. That's great but what if we have a treatment that has an unexpected effect on another gene? That again might relate in a different unexpected outcome that may or may not be beneficial. And then importantly what if there are side effects? Can we stop the treatment? Gene therapy is hard to take away. The ASOs, that might be a different story. In some of these other RNA-based treatments medications that we use today you can give the medication or taper it off if there are side effects and take it away. So we need to be careful in thinking about how do we do that for some of these novel therapies so that we're always having a beneficial and not a deleterious effect on the patients that we treat.<br> So I think I'll just end by saying I think there's been a huge, you know, increase in our understanding of the genetics of epilepsy. I showed you that there were, you know, 100 different genes and this has been extremely useful in the clinical setting and for connecting families and scientists to better understand these disorders and every single one of these wants a precision therapy and I think there are a lot of people out there working on it and there's a lot of promise. It's important to remember that we can use, you know, studies in in cell culture and cellular models, the model organism studies in mice, zebrafish and other organisms are going to be really important and they take time. And then many of you are probably engaged in research which is fantastic because using patient cells also helps us as well where we can use patient cells to study different types of cells using a stem cell approach that can allow us to make brain-like cells to better understand the disease.</p><p>I'm going to leave you with this again to remind you that SYNGAP1 is one of the early players. I think you know that means that actually people have been studying it for a long time before it was identified as a human disease-causing gene and this, you know, 10-12 years here has given us the chance to identify lots of affected individuals especially now that these tests are widely available in the clinic and to understand what is the phenotypic spectrum, what's the mutation spectrum and how can we use that to understand the disorder and develop these therapies. I think that is my last slide. I will stop there and I'd be happy to take questions. </p><p>Mike: Thank you&nbsp;very, very, very much. That was amazing. I think we're going to make this recording required viewing for every newly diagnosed family. Do you want to take down your screen just so we can put faces on? So, three things, Dr Mefford and then I would encourage everybody who's watching to just throw throw in questions in the Q&amp;A. The first thing I want to say is thank you both for this remarkable and thorough talk but also for all your great work. You know your name was on those papers that helped identify this gene that our kids have so amazing and we're just so grateful and also for your work with us on the SAB. I have two questions one that I feel like I have to ask because it's probably top of mind for many parents and one that I want to ask because I'm dying to ask you. So the one that's top of mind is VUSs right. We have parents who got a VUS on their Invitae panel and then x years later it was resequenced or the phenotype presented in such a way and, like, how should parents think about VUSs? What does that mean and then sub question there what is the difference between an intronic VUS which which a few people have and then the phenotype gets so profound it's determined to be pathogenic and what would a VUS be that's not intronic? So that's like I think the question I have to ask for the Syngap family audience and I'd love to hear from you about that and then I'll... then the other... I'll wait for the other question because that was enough. </p><p>Dr Mefford:&nbsp;Yeah so I will tell you that the VUSs are as frustrating for us as clinicians and scientists as they are for families and it's sometimes the most difficult kind of, you know, visits to have when you have to give family a result that is uncertain. I think it's, you know, sometimes geneticists can take a report that says this is you know a VUS and we can say \"no it's not. I know this is disease-causing\" or \"no it's not. I know this is not causing disease in this family\" using lots of different tools and experience but often that's not the case and so when that happens, you know, I think it's important to engage with, if you can, with someone who knows a lot about the gene. Still might not give you the answer but to also over time remember to revisit these things because you can, you know, we do ask for reinterpretation of variants over time because interpretation can change. It can change because we've identified additional similar patients with the same genetic change and start to say \"okay, this is actually, we think this is actually causative\" or you find unaffected people with the same change and then you can say \"we don't think this is the cause in your family\". If you've had targeted testing it doesn't really happen very often anymore usually these are pretty big gene panels but even with a big gene panel, you know, you can expand that test to a whole exome and say \"well, did we miss something and this is not actually the cause there's another cause?\" and then sometimes there are follow-up tests you can do. So intronic VUSs, you know, the thought is that some of those might affect splicing. So we understand splicing to a certain degree but we don't understand it fully and so sometimes we can say \"gosh, I don't know if this affects splicing or not\". We're getting better at developing tools to predict whether it affects splicing. I still think it's hard to base your entire clinical decision making on a, you know, AI tool or, you know, a bioinformatics tool but it can be helpful and or you can go in and and do more experiments but again you have to connect yourself to a research lab that was willing, or sometimes you can do it clinically, to do these experiments to say does it actually have the effects that we think it has that would be a disease causing effect? And sometimes that takes years to be perfectly honest. So just know that it's frustrating. I think the hard thing too is that I will tell you as a geneticist the hardest thing that I ever have to do is take away a diagnosis and so there are cases where people might get a VUS and connect themselves and just engage, you know, in the family community and research community and with the belief that this is the cause and years later we might figure out that it's not, right. So I think just knowing that that's a possibility you know if you have a VUS but there's nothing else to go on, you know, connecting yourself to a community is important regardless because affected kids are affected kids and many of them have the same types of, you know, issues and challenges so connecting with families is important but knowing that that may go away someday I think can be really hard but it's important to have that kind of in the back of your mind. That makes sense? </p><p>Mike: Thank you. Yeah it does. It does. My message to anyone with a VUS is interrogate it more. Find an expert. Do an RNA test if it's intronic whatever...</p><p>Dr Mefford:&nbsp;I think the other thing to know is that for some genes, you know, people are starting to develop assays where we test every single change. So if you know... if pathogenic variants cause the gene to act in a certain way or not act in a certain way and you can test that, you know, then we can say \"well, let's take your VUS and let's test it and see if it acts the way we think it should\". You can also say \"you know what, we're just going to do this for every single possible variant in the gene and then we're going to have a record of this variant as normal, this variant acts like a disease variant\". Those are hard to do and you have to have the right test and blah blah blah but those those kinds of tests are starting to happen for lots of different genes so that we can proactively have the information rather than saying \"oh, don't know. Give us the variant and we'll take a few years to figure it out\" right. Yeah so that's probably down the road. I don't know that it exists for SYNGAP1 but someday it might. </p><p>Mike: So the second question and then I'll let you go to the Q&amp;A where they're piling up, is about Stoke and SCN1A and SYNGAP1 in the flight path. So what I mean by that is, like, you know when when we have on our board Hans Schlecht who teaches me something new every day and one day he was like \"SCN1A is the one. That's how you remember. That's&nbsp;Dravet\" and because it's the biggest one and it was the first one and so I'm always looking to that to see what's next for us and what I try to say to parents is it's important we watch these other major genes because we're a half step behind them and I think Syngap really&nbsp;is a half step behind them because we have a large estimated prevalence, we're a classic haploinsufficiency and these are all very Dravet answers. Even in the case of Stoke, if you read their patent, that mechanism is for two genes SCN1A and SYNGAP1 but where we get off the path is, you know, thank god our seizures aren't as catastrophic as Dravet but it also makes it harder to figure out what you're going to test. Like, those mice died or they didn't. Right. Our mice don't die they just behave oddly and fail weird tests. How do patients think about that ASO versus other ASOs and what is... here's the question: based on everything that's going on with ASOs and Dravet and the speed of change how how hopeful should our parents be? I know it's going to be an impossible question like how many years do we get a therapy for our kids but should we be thinking months, years or decades? I mean orders of magnitude here? Like, what's what's a reasonable hope if we keep pushing? </p><p>Dr Mefford: I'd like to say months. I think&nbsp;realistically it's years. I think it's better&nbsp;than decades so I think, you know, given the time that it takes to do these experiments in mice, to make sure that it's safe, I mean I think it's a little off track but thinking about how we're watching the COVID vaccine development right. That is science in real time and now the whole world is watching and it's going to take time, right. The record to make a vaccine is absolute record is four years and now we're pushing it to six months to a year and you're seeing all the steps in the process and how that works and so I think just I only say that because I think it kind of gives us a sense of how science works and where what the challenges are and how fast we can actually move. You know it'd be great to have a warp speed program for ASO development right and I think we're getting there and I think having industry involved and engaged in rare disease research and treatment is huge and I think we can be hopeful and I do think you have to be cautiously optimistic because again all of the issues of when do you need to treat how soon or how you know what part of the disease process will it actually make an appreciable difference is important. It's important to be realistic about that and I think your question about what is it that you're treating is very important. So seizures are an easy end point to look at. Development's harder. Especially when you have a range of development. Behavior's harder but behavior is huge right and as you all know it's important and so I think figuring out what those endpoints are going to be and what order of magnitude of change do you want to see in treated kids versus those who don't get the treatment are all things that we have to be thinking about. </p><p>Mike: Yeah and I think having remarkable people like yourself lending your good name to our gene can't hurt when companies are making choices so thank you again. I'm gonna go to the questions. There's seven in there right now and I'm gonna start at the bottom with the names that I know. So Dr Schlecht is asking could you talk about the Angelman ASO if you're familiar with that and if you're not... I'm not sure I'm familiar enough to talk about it intelligently. I know it's out there. I know it's happening. It's a slightly different mechanism but it is an ASO therapy that is in development and I think again it's important to watch that space. And then J.R. is asking a question right above Hans is when will the data analysis strategies be ready to look at whole genome data as a way to find modifiers of disease? Who would do this for SYNGAP1? And then I'll give you her other... okay one at a time, go ahead. </p><p>Dr Mefford: No, no, I think the modifier question is really interesting and it's a hard question. It's definitely something we've thought about not just with SYNGAP1 but with some other disorders where there's really variable outcomes and I think the key is doing exactly what you're doing: identifying and bringing families together who are willing to participate in research because in my mind it's going to take numbers, right, because (unless you get really lucky) so think about modifiers right what could be modifying this? Lots of different genetic variants but to find it you have to have a concentration of variants in a set of patients with similar phenotypes right and to do that takes collecting lots of data on phenotypes and takes probably lots of patients to study on the either the exome or genome basis. So, you know, we can talk about doing that eventually and we definitely thought about it and again I think similar to the questions about treatment outcomes you have to think about what are the variables that you're looking for that you're modifying, right. The development of the seizures that you either... yeah. </p><p>Mike: Yeah. Million dollar questions. All right. So JR asked another question: since we know SYNGAP1 mutations are fairly prevalent in ID and epilepsy how do we go about finding older patients? This is a super cool question because by the way we just found a 65 year old by accident. Yes I heard. A doctor was real and we're making a movie about... but that's another thing. Most of us have young patients or parents of teenagers that push for diagnosis. What is the ethical way to go about this? I think \"this\" meaning finding older patients. </p><p>Dr Mefford: So I think there's a lot of movement in both the clinical community and research community to do genetic testing in older patients. So, you know, older patients didn't have the advantage of having this technology available or even knowing that Syngap caused you know similar phenotype to theirs so there are some good, couple good recent studies looking at older populations. I think the way to do it is to engage adult epileptologists and physicians in general who would see patients like this, right, to get them to do genetic testing which means getting insurance to coverage testing in that population and to engage researchers in finding populations right who... they're out there they just haven't had the advantage of testing. So thinking about, you know, you could go to group homes where people live. The challenge with this is getting consent for research and we've talked about that with one of our adult neurologists here who cares for a lot of these patients but often it's figuring out who gives consent, you know, for a blood draw for genetic testing? Who gets the results and what do you do with that information? So I think thinking carefully about how we get to those populations both on a research and clinical side is important. I think it is really important for families to be able to look ahead and say what are the issues that are going to come up in my kids when they're 30, 40, 50 or older? How long will they live? Are there things that will shorten their lifespan and what are those and how do we, you know, prevent that?</p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Got it okay thank you two more so the bottom three questions and I'm just I'm sorry i'm prioritizing the parents questions before I get to the other ones. So Hans says is provider hesitancy to refer NGS going away or stubbornly sticking around and then there's another question on we often (I think this is related so I'm going to bundle them) we often come across stories of clinicians telling undiagnosed families that sequencing won't change the management of the family's disease and/or insurance can't cover it which of course ridiculous because we have Behind the Seizure but that was editorial what would you say to those doctors what can we do as patient advocates to get more diagnoses and then she's got to follow on what are your thoughts on a nationwide sequencing study similar to the DDD in the UK?</p><p>Dr Mefford: That would be great. I'd love to do that. As far as I think the insurance question is a hard one and you know not changing management not, you know, I think that's not necessarily true. So, you know, when I write my notes we always talk about at least the handful of genes where we'll change management because usually we're asking for a panel or an exome and we can say you know the phenotypes overlap it cannot predict by looking at this child clinically what their mutation will be and it's important because the diagnosis will change the management and it'll also give prognosis information. If insurance still won't cover the cost... find a research study, you know, we enroll kids all the time you know there are many groups around who are studying this. Studying you know similar phenotypes and are willing to enroll kids I think you know it's always I'll be honest you know sometimes it's challenging for us too right because I'm not a diagnostic lab and so you know me finding a mutation doesn't go into your clinical you know it doesn't necessarily go into your electronic medical record. So there are challenges that way but I think but but usually you can find someone who's willing to do that. I do think that you know encouraging the other thing is that and it's a hard sell for insurance companies but you know having a diagnosis puts you in a position right to be ready when it will change management right. It puts you in a position to be ready to join the clinical trials when they're available for a new therapy that might be effective so it might not change your management today but it might change it tomorrow or next week or next month and I personally think that's important most insurance companies would say well that's that's still research so we're not paying for that but that's ridiculous. So as you know how do you advocate? I think you know working with your physician to say no it's you know in some cases it does change management and finding you know researchers and physician researchers like myself and many others that are around say to help you fight those battles it's not easy I know there's nothing more frustrating for me than when I can't... a person's insurance won't cover the testing it's like what do you do? Yeah and then Hans said the provider hasn't seemed to refer Next Generation Sequencing going away or stubbornly sticking around and does that just fall under the insurance answer? Well I think geneticists aren't hesitant to send testing you know I think that some some neurologists might be hesitant some general providers might be hesitant because the interpretation is important right and so I think you need to be able to to interpret the results of the test that you send and give that information back to your patient or engage you know the right people geneticists genetic counselors you can do that. I don't Next Generation Sequencing is not going away so I'm hopeful that, you know, our neurologists here are much much more comfortable sending those tests. They're not always still comfortable with the results but they're at least getting the testing done. </p><p>Mike: Yeah it's weird to tell parents that they're lucky when they have a diagnosis they sort of look at you like this is the worst news ever you're like well yeah there's a lot of people who never made it this far. Okay so we got four questions left and we're at the top of the hour so I'm gonna if anyone has asked a question throw them in so at the top epilepsy is a tricky phenotype to study and model what are some animal models or in vitro models that Dr. Mefford thinks are particularly helpful for studying genetic epilepsies?</p><p>Dr Mefford: Depends on the gene. You know, mouse models are generally helpful but they're expensive and they take time there are people developing zebrafish models for lots of epilepsy-related genes that are faster and cheaper and allow kind of high throughput drug screening so that's happening and cellular models. I think, you know, all these all have caveats of course but, you know, cellular models and making things like organoids from stem cells is likely to be helpful down the road as well.</p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Yeah we're excited about what Coba is doing there. He's building a bunch of patient derived organoids. And I'd love to hear your thoughts on how your (this is their words not mine) how her incredible analysis of 1200 DEE cohort helped our understanding of the clinical overlap in epilepsy, ASD, and other developmental disorders many thanks to Dr. Mefford for this seminar. </p><p>Dr Mefford: Yeah that's been&nbsp;fun we've kind of always known there was an overlap but I think that's just become more and more evident and so we're working on a paper right now where we sequenced 200 some undiagnosed kids and their parents and tried to identify the underlying cause and about half of them where we've been able to make a diagnosis it's for neurodevelopmental disorder. Not as what you think of your DEE. I think, you know, so I think there's a lot of there's a lot of overlap. I do think there are certain genes like SYNGAP1 where if you have a pathogenic variant in that gene your risk for epilepsy is high. There are others where it's not. So there are definitely some distinctions. Also a lot of blurring. I also think it's important to remember that I test patients who come from neurologists who study epilepsy. So their primary diagnosis is epilepsy. I work with other providers who see kids with neurodevelopmental disorders so they might focus on the developmental piece and say \"oh, by the way they have epilepsy too\". So some of it is the bias, you know, an ascertainment bias and kind of where they came from and what diagnosis they're \"labeled with\" which, you know, could probably be one of three different diagnoses or four right. Is it ID with epilepsy or epilepsy with ID? Is it autism with epilepsy or is it a DEE? Some of them are distinctive but many are not. </p><p>Mike: Yeah or is it just an unholy trinity? Oh&nbsp;so anonymous attendee says is it possible to test epilepsy and family members to predict if a future child a family will have epilepsy? </p><p>Dr Mefford: I guess the question here is inherited versus de novo and maybe yeah you know the inherited and milder epilepsies tend to be more complex so there's often not a single gene that's not true for all is it possible to predict if you know the mutation in a family member who has epilepsy then yes you can use that information to test other family members if they're interested but a lot of the times it's it's complicated and for a lot of the DEEs these aren't inherited. I think it's important to remember that they can be, right. A parent can have you know 10% of sperm or eggs that have a mutation and can have a second affected child that's an important thing to discuss with your geneticist and prenatal provider if you have one affected kid.</p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Right. He doesn't stop. </p><p>Dr Mefford:&nbsp;I can talk a lot about&nbsp;that paper. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Do you want to do that next?</p><p>Dr Mefford: Sure I can do that quickly. So it's exactly what I was talking about. So that we wrote a paper looking at the risk of having a second affected child when it's a new mutation in the first child and this speaks to what I was just saying what we call parental mosaicism or gonadal mosaicism&nbsp;as a parent. We've known for decades that this this happened in lots of different disorders&nbsp;where the mutation appears to be new in the child and most of the time it is and it just happens&nbsp;once it's a single sperm or egg that's affected it's passed on the child has the disease and&nbsp;it never happens again but what we found when we looked really carefully at parents who had a&nbsp;child with a de novo mutation causing epilepsy and now other studies have done a similar thing, five to ten percent of parents are actually mosaic for the&nbsp;mutation which means that it's not a zero chance that that will happen&nbsp;again. It's an increased chance. It's a there's a real chance that&nbsp;another child could be affected. It is important for prenatal counseling because we need to, you know, impart this to parents. We can't just&nbsp;say \"it's never gonna happen again\".&nbsp;<br> And yeah having one normal child does not help&nbsp;necessarily because if you have 10%, you can think of it... and this usually happens in the sperm, so you can think of it as 10% of the sperm were affected right because maybe there's a 10% chance that it'll&nbsp;happen again but a 90% chance that it won't. So what's difficult is actually if we can't find it&nbsp;in the blood or the saliva of parents we can't find a mutation that's reassuring but it's not&nbsp;100% because it could be present in sperm. We can test sperm. Not many places do it but it can be&nbsp;done. We can't test eggs. It's too invasive. So yeah so I think it's important to remember that, you know, even if it doesn't look like the parents are mosaic it&nbsp;can happen again and if it's something you're concerned about you know there are options for&nbsp;prenatal testing for pre-implantation genetic diagnosis as far as de novo disorders but you know&nbsp;these are all things that can be discussed with a prenatal provider. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;And there's one last question on here about blood brain barrier in treating epilepsy and how it affects drug treatment. I guess the question here is around delivery? Does that complicate? </p><p>Dr Mefford:&nbsp;It does&nbsp;yeah I mean you have to get it across that blood brain barrier so it does complicate things in that you have to have the right type of you know small molecule or therapy. I don't&nbsp;know enough about the specifics to say what works and what doesn't but I think it's it's always&nbsp;a consideration when you're treating a disorder like this, that you get it into the right cells. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Right awesome thank you so I have one last&nbsp;question just because we we mentioned that we did find that that 65 year old patient and we're so&nbsp;excited about it we're actually doing a short movie about it so look forward to seeing that in a few months but what was cool there what I heard about was normally when people say trio testing they test kid and mom and dad to&nbsp;compare but in the case of this patient, if I've got the story straight, mom and dad&nbsp;weren't around anymore so they tested patient and both of her sisters how does that&nbsp;work through like how do I explain that, like, is that harder to do? Is it...? </p><p>Dr Mefford:&nbsp;Yeah so that's similar to Hans' question I think and that, well, sort of, they probably did that... so for example if&nbsp;you have a VUS which is another thing you can do with the VUS is to say well, I've got three unaffected siblings. Let's test them. If they have that same VUS probably not causative. It's probably a benign variant, right, if they're healthy. So testing the sisters in that case helps if they're negative for the same change in saying okay they're not affected they don't have the&nbsp;change she's affected she has the change or he's affected he has a change. That helps.&nbsp;It's not 100% but it's certainly supportive evidence right and if in that individual if it&nbsp;was a truncating mutation, for example, you could be pretty confident and testing the siblings&nbsp;again helps it may actually not be necessary right because we know that truncating variants yeah but simply extended family members can help with the VUS's sometimes. </p><p>Mike:&nbsp;got it and it was cool about that is they they weren't testing for the they were trying to rule because because dad&nbsp;wasn't around they were trying to rule out okay is our current health issues inherited so&nbsp;let's make sure there isn't some known I don't know whatever and they stumbled across&nbsp;it and it just that story's so exciting because it begs this question how many more are there who&nbsp;we could be helping that we don't even know about?Dr Mefford:&nbsp;They're definitely out there for sure. <br>Mike:&nbsp;On that happy note I can't I don't have the words to thank you for everything you do and for doing this webinar. My pleasure. So we are grateful. </p><p>Dr Mefford:&nbsp;I hope it was helpful.</p><p>Mike:&nbsp;It was. </p><p>Dr Mefford: You guys are doing great work. Keep it up. </p><p>Mike: Thanks. Thank you so much. Bye-bye. Thanks. Bye.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p>",

The goals of the series are:</p><ul><li>getting you closer to the science&nbsp;</li><li>making you aware of the research that is been done and the opportunities to participate</li><li>and empowering your communications with clinicians&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Our next webinar that will be taking place is Thursday December 10th at 12CST. This will be with Dr. James Holder of Baylor College of Medicine.</p><p>Our talk today with Dr. Sanders is titled “SynGAP1 in the Developing Human Cortex”. Dr. Sanders speaks to us today with experience in a number of different roles related to patients with developmental disabilities and autism spectrum disorder. He was first a pediatrician in his home country, the United Kingdom. In 2007, he and his wife moved to the United States where he signed on for a postdoctoral research position at Yale in Dr. Matthew State’s lab and completed his PhD work. He is currently an Assistant Professor at UCSF in the Department of Psychiatry.</p><p>Dr. Sanders’ work in genetics has been instrumental in developing our understanding of how de novo mutations are associated with autism spectrum disorder. Working with the Simons Simplex Collection, exome sequencing was used to develop early methods for identifying genes linked to autism. Further down the line, Sanders lab has prioritized characterizing and studying in depth genes which are strongly associated with ASD. Notably, his lab’s work on SCNA2 has combined genetic data with knowledge about the protein’s structure to understand both the gain and loss of function mutations and the differing phenotypes that they produce.</p><p>Sanders has continued to contribute to elucidating genetic links to autism by combining multiple cohorts including copy number variant data and exome data. In 2015 he published a paper identifying 71 risk loci for autism and SynGAP1 was included as a risk gene. His lab is broadening our understanding further by developing and applying new statistical methods to analyze non-coding regions of the genome to illuminate the pathways in gene regulation which may contribute to autism.</p><p>His pioneering work in genetics has benefitted many patient communities and we are appreciative for him sharing with us today about that as well as some of his specific knowledge on SynGAP1.</p><p>At the end of this presentation, you will have an opportunity to get your questions answered. We’d love to hear from you – please write your question in the chat.</p><p>For those of you just joining us, welcome to our talk today by Dr. Stephan Sanders entitled “SynGAP1 in the Developing Human Cortex”. You will be able to find a recorded version of this talk on the SRF website as well as on SRF’s YouTube Channel.<br></p>",
