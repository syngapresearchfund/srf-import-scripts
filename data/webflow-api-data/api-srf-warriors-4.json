			"full-story": "<p>Anton is full of life and is a very happy child. He received the Syngap1 diagnosis in June of 2019. He has taught our family a lot about patience and understanding. We love him so much.</p><p>He goes to a special kindergarten where they are able to cater to his needs. Similar to other kids with Syngap1, he’s in many different therapies to help improve his skills. Anton is non-verbal but he can communicate using sign language (he has about 35 signs). Just recently, he got an iPad to use for communication and that has been helping a lot. We feel that although he cannot express himself verbally that he understands most of what we say.</p><p>Anton does not have any visible seizures but his EEG’s have shown “abnormal brain activity”. So we believe that he may be having seizures that we cannot see.</p><p>Anton enjoys spending all of his time outdoors. He loves going on walks in the woods. Anton can spend lots of time at the playground, climbing on the structures. Swimming, horses, playing with toys, music, and dancing are a few of his favorite things.</p><p> - Claudia, mom<br></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Colette was diagnosed with SYNGAP1-related NSID in 2018. She received an early autism diagnosis in 2014 and we just “knew” that there was going to be more to her story. We saw a lot of things we’ve since learned are extremely common among others in the community: delayed/non-existent verbal communication, absence seizures, low muscle tone, and so on. Getting the results of her genetic testing was a huge relief - we could finally put a more definitive name to her experience.</p><p>Colette is nonverbal but does use a combination of echolalia, gestures, sign language, and a speech app on her iPad to communicate. Luckily, she successfully controls her absence seizures with medication. Colette has a stubborn streak and thrives in familiar environments like many other kids we’ve learned about.</p><p>Physically, Colette has the low muscle tone and lack of coordination you might expect. Her pain tolerance is through the roof! She has broken her arm, split her forehead open, and taken countless tumbles over the years but we’re hard-pressed to remember a single time she has cried from pain. Tough doesn’t even begin to describe her.</p><p>Colette spends a lot of time in her many therapies: OT, speech, HAB, music, equine, and the list goes on. We’ve learned to celebrate her progress every step of the way. What might seem small to a “typical” family is often an enormous achievement for her.</p><p>Despite her challenges, Colette is a good-natured kid. She enjoys spending time with her family and can be incredibly affectionate, especially with her brother (even if he’d rather her not sometimes!). She’s very friendly with all of her therapists, teachers, and friends. She loves music, movies, and rollercoasters.</p><p>Thanks for reading about our kiddo - we’ve enjoyed reading about all of yours.<br>.</p>",

			"name": "Tarik",
			"location": "Bosnia",
			"full-story": "<p>Tarik was born in Tuzla and was born healthy. He cried a lot as a baby and eventually was diagnosed with torticollis, and it was corrected with physical therapy. Quickly, we realized he was not meeting his milestones. Started walking and his first word both happened at the age of 2. He still has very minimal language.</p><p>Tarik was diagnosed with Syngap1 in December of 2019 (in Barcelona). He does not suffer from epilepsy or sleep issues. Tarik does have many traits of autism but has not had a diagnosis.</p><p>Occupational and Speech Therapy have greatly helped Tarik. We have even tried using a hyperbaric chamber.</p><p>Tarik has no sense of fear, which means he requires constant supervision. He can become very upset when he is misunderstood and gets aggressive with those around him. Tarik does not like school, so we are hoping to find a better fit for him someday. As he has grown older, he has become very difficult to manage as he has aggressive outbursts. As of now it is relatively controlled with the help of medication.</p><p>He loves music and animals. Swimming and going for long walks are some of the activities he greatly enjoys. Loves watching rhyming videos! He has a good memory; he remembers people and names, as well as symbols.</p><p>In Bosnia, life is difficult, but with a sick child it is even worse. We hope to be able to somehow move to Germany, where the conditions for Tarik will be better. Tarik is the center of our world and my husband and I will devote our lives to him alone.</p><p>Best regards from beautiful Bosnia and Herzegovina. I wish all of us a lot of positive energy, strength, and health to fight through life.<br></p>",

At 18 months old we had a diagnosis of hypermobility and then slowly learnt of many other delays and at 3 years and 3 months came an autism diagnosis. In early 2019, we finally received the Syngap1 diagnosis when Stanley was 5 years old. The reason behind all of his delays.</p><p>Stanley attends a fantastic specialist provision school and is slowly making progress in all areas. He is non verbal and uses makaton sign mainly for communication.</p><p>His main struggles are transitions, obsessive behaviours and sleep problems. He can become anxious and frustrated which can result in aggressive behaviours. (Only really towards his parents and brother). Despite the challenges he faces Stanley is mostly a very happy and very loving little boy. He loves balloons and aeroplanes and anything that flies! He has a great sense of humour and an infections laugh. We work hard to support Stanley and are very fortunate to have great family and friends supporting us. He is a very loved little boy and has the best little big brother he could ask for.</p><p><br></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>After many tests and seeing countless specialists, roughly 5 years ago. Jaxon was given the Syngap1 diagnosis. I say roughly because we were only told MRD5, and didn’t realize others in our little rare community referred to it as Syngap.&nbsp;</p><p>Our Jaxon also has non progressive white brain matter loss. He has significant portions that did not develop in the right front and left sides of his brain. Due to this lack of white matter, an arachnoid cyst has developed on the base of his brain and stem. The lack of white brain matter significantly impacts his symptoms of Syngap, or so our neurogeneticist explains. He is non-verbal but gets his points across with either his speech device, simple gestures, or noises (crying, demanding yell, etc). He does have epilepsy with multiple seizure types. These are currently under control with meds. He doesn’t sleep well at all and never has! He has feeding issues and has had to use thickeners for his drinks in the past due to aspiration. We have to monitor his eating closely as he will choke. However, that doesn’t stop him from enjoying his favorite foods: chocolate milk shakes, powdered donuts, fruit cups, Doritos and cheeseburgers, to name a few!</p><p>Despite his health and behavior issues (he can have a bit of a bossy temper) he is a happy kid that is loving and affectionate with his family! He loves his big brothers, Taren-20, and Mason-15. He loves school, playing outside, going to Walmart, McDonald’s, Youtube kids, and throwing rocks at the boat landing on the Wabash River. We live only lives a couple of hours away from Ty, another Syngap Warrior! We visit when we can!</p><p><br></p>",

She also loves water and is a pretty good swimmer. Kasia could spend all day outdoors playing with plants, feeling the wind and just exploring the surroundings. </p><p>Kasia has a rare genetic mutation called Syngap1. She was diagnosed in October 2020 after three years of searching for a reason for her developmental delays. She was born a seemingly healthy baby, it wasn’t until 6 months her eyes started shaking and she was diagnosed with nystagmus. We also noticed a gross motor delay and started testing. She had brain scans, evaluations, and everything was coming back normal. We started physical therapy. She crawled at 14 months and started independently walking at 2 years, 4 months. She was delayed but we were hoping she would catch up. At 16 months we added speech, occupational and feeding therapies. </p><p>At 3 years old--when she still wasn’t speaking--we took her to a geneticist. Diagnosis gave us a road map to her medical condition and soon after we learned that she is having frequent seizures, we just didn’t recognize them. We also gained a support group of friends with children with the same diagnosis, which was and is a lifeline for us. When you are a parent and you learn that your child is very ill with a rare disease you think that there is no hope, no one will care. The incredible parents of SRF gave us realistic expectations, hope for treatment/cure and a chance for our Kasia to have a life we all want for her. We believe in her and I hope the world will too.</p>",

She loves horses, tractors, boats, trains, Ford Mustangs, police cars, fire trucks and motorcycles…basically anything that goes fast! She loves her family and her people fiercely. She enjoys listening to music on her iPad…it is usually children’s songs about her favorite things…and a lot of the time she is listening to them in Portuguese. Mabry’s dad pushes her in half marathons all over the state of Texas! She loves to be on the move…so we drive A LOT!</p><p>Mabry just recently received her Syngap1 diagnosis in October of 2019 after a repeat genetic test (the third round). She also has Epilepsy and Autism. Mabry is considered non-verbal and uses signs and gestures for a lot of her communication, but she has words that her family and close friends are able to understand. We deal with meltdowns and behaviors consistent with Autism. Mabry is stubborn, persistent, determined, smart, sneaky, loving, hysterical and goofy all at the same time. She is my hero!</p><p>-Mom</p><p><br></p>",

She is a happy little girl except for when she can’t get her own way.&nbsp; She is able to communicate verbally at a basic level. Her best sentence to date is ‘I can’t do it mum help me do it. Molly has slept 12 hours a night solid from 4 weeks old. She is also toilet trained for #1 but not #2.</p><p>Molly loves food and eats everything apart from olives. She has always loved books. Molly loves stickers, water play, swimming. She is in top set for swimming in her resource base class at school! Molly love horse back riding, the beach, and holidaying.</p><p>Molly can ride a bike with stabilizers on. She loves to run free, which terrifies us as she has zero sense of danger.&nbsp; She’s a reluctant learner but knows her numbers and knows around 12 letters. She is starting to be able to put letters together to form simple 3 letter words. Molly would watch tv or iPad 24/7 if we let her.&nbsp; She gets obsessed with tv programs for months and we all have to adopt names from the show!&nbsp; Her current obsession is fireman Sam. Molly has a great sense of humor - to the point it can be used to diffuse her temper. She brings us joy and frustration in equal measure.</p><p><br></p>",

His favorite thing to do is to go train spotting, he can spend a few hours a day viewing his favorite trains and visiting train stations. We are working on Brendan being able to revisit activities that he once enjoyed before his health declined - such as swimming and horse riding. Brendan enjoys watching his favorite shows: Trains, Wheel of Fortune, Addams Family, and The Flinstones. He has a great sense of humor and is a great guy to be around.

			"full-story": "<p>We got the call from our geneticist last year on New Year’s Eve that our Christian had Syngap1. As his mother, I’ve always been his biggest advocate. I knew something was awry when Christian was around 12 months old and was not reaching some developmental milestones.</p><p>Christian began physical and occupational therapy around 14 months old. It was Christian’s occupational therapist who alerted us that Christian was having seizures. We were naïve that seizures came in so many types, so we simply did not know. We immediately took Christian to a neurologist who has helped tremendously. Christian has atonic seizures and eyelid myoclonia. Last December Christian had a corpus callosotomy performed which has dropped his atonic seizures from hundreds a day to 0-2 a day. Christian was also diagnosed with autism just last week so now he will be starting ABA therapy shortly. We hope to see some gains from this therapy.</p><p>Christian is the sweetest boy. He loves hugs and kisses and being tickled.&nbsp; He loves water and will play in it for hours. He loves his kiddie pool and bubble baths are his favorite. Christian loves to watch Sesame Street and even claps along to the songs. He loves car rides with the window down so the wind can blow in his face. Christian is surrounded by love from his family. Christian brings us so much joy and we could not imagine our lives without him.</p><p> - Mom</p><p><br></p>",

After an exhaustive amount of doctor visits and advocating for some help, he was finally referred for multiple services. From then on Caspian had weekly visits with speech therapy and physiotherapy. And after a few months with the habilitation team Caspian was diagnosed with Autism at the age of 2. At 18 months of age Caspian started eating for the first time and by 2.5 years of age he was eating enough to stop breast feeding safely.</p><p>Sadly we had a little turn back in October 2019 when what we thought was autistic stimming behavior turned into an epilepsy diagnosis. Caspian started medication right away however, none were doing the trick. They took CT scans, spinal fluid, EEG and genetic testing. All tests came back normal, it was just the genetic. test we waited a few months for...</p><p>In May of 2020, our beautiful son received a new diagnosis of Syngap1 syndrome. Even though this was a huge surprise for us, this new diagnosis gives us answers to why Caspian has such difficult epilepsy.</p><p>Caspian is a very happy and playful little boy. He laughs a lot and loves cuddles from those who are close to him. Water has always been his favorite everything! Right now water is his relaxation when he has a lot of seizures a bath relaxes him and his seizures seem to rest for a while. He also loves the trampoline and he has just recently learnt to jump by himself with the help from his big sister, who is usually teaching him all those fun skills! And another passion of his is dancing and music! Caspian's laugh and smile can melt anyone's heart when he dances with you!</p><p>- Mom</p><p><em>To learn more about Caspian you can read </em><a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/caspian\" target=\"_blank\"><em>this article</em></a><em> by his mom or </em><a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/caspian-got-a-g-tube\" target=\"_blank\"><em>this one about his G-Tube</em></a><em>.</em><br></p>",

He started to walk at 2 years old and since then, he has been in Occupational, Speech, and Physical Therapy. After almost 9 years of countless exams (EEGs, genetic tests, and MRI’s) he got the Syngap1 diagnosis.</p><p>Nowadays he goes to a specialized center to get individual comprehensive therapies. Simón has made slow progress, although he has no verbal language (he only says Dad, Mom, and Tata to his sister), he understands everything and is very persuasive. He makes himself understood through signs and gestures. Simón has no diagnosis of epilepsy. However, his fine motor skills are poorly developed and he has difficulties with attention. He walks, runs, moves easily, eats and sleeps very well.</p><p>Simón is a like a box of surpirses. He is cheerful, tender, and happy, however, he has a low tolerance for frustration when he is denied access. Thus, he can be self-aggressive, hitting himself on the head and loud screaming.</p><p>He loves music, animals, horseback riding, going to the movies, parties, swimming, anything technological, and playing puppets.</p><p>Simón is our reason for being and worth fighting for. The whole family revolves around his well-being, progress, and happiness.</p><p><br></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Emma was diagnosed with Syngap1 in September 2019. Out of all my kids, she was absolutely the easiest as a baby. Emma started sleeping through the night at one week old and was so happy all the time. She was slow at hitting milestones so we had her tested for Autism at 20 months old. They told us they felt her delay was genetic (not autism related) so we did further testing and found she had a micro duplication of chromosome 5. That left us with many unanswered questions.</p><p>As she has gotten older, things have gotten harder. At 2, Emma was diagnosed with epilepsy. She suffers from many types of seizures. Currently, they are under control with medication. Emma started having sleeping issues at the age of 4. She needs to take several meds to help with that, but she still sometimes struggles with sleep. Her obsessive, compulsive, and aggressive behaviors started really becoming problematic at age 6. They have only worsened since.</p><p>Emma was re tested, and was finally diagnosed with Autism as well. Lately she has been doing anything she can to run away. She has to constantly be watched. She is globally delayed and nonverbal. She also has hypotonia, sensory processing disorder, very high pain tolerance, and still in diapers. Emma uses sign language and pictures to communicate. She has one word - “bye-bye”.</p><p>When Emma has good days, she has a smile that can light up a room. She loves being cuddled and kissed. I know everyone falls in love with her when they meet her. Her laughter is contagious, I love hearing her sweet voice. She loves riding across bridges, jumping on the trampoline, watching Bubble Guppies, and anything to do with water. We finally felt like the Syngap diagnosis gave us some much needed answers. We pray one day they can find a treatment that can help her and all of the others diagnosed.</p><p> - Mom</p><p><br></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Elisabet was born in March, 2015 as a healthy baby. She ate, slept, and smiled a lot! Life was not perfect, it was more than that.</p><p>After about 6 months, her development slowed down in every aspect. After her 1st birthday a lot of tests were done to try and figure exactly what was the cause. None of the tests showed any cause or reason. But we already knew that time is moving more quickly than her development. We made peace with the fact that our little fairy will be different.</p><p>A few weeks before her 3rd birthday we got an answer, Syngap1. Elisabet has intellectual disorder, severe epilespy, autism, gait difficulties, and is non-verbal. The hardest thing for Elisabet is learning communication. The combination of intellectual disorder and epilepsy make for a tricky combination. Also it’s often difficult to go even for a short walk or do some outside activities because she simply likes being indoors best. Elisabet can make it pretty impossible to walk with her if she doesn’t want to walk </p><p>Despite the differences and difficulties her special needs cause, we as a family do everything for her. But we have tried to keep it balanced. Everyone in our family is important and needs to have a nice daily life and enough support and attention from both parents. Elisabet has an older brother (Oskar) and a younger sister (Marta).</p><p>We have hard days, and hard hours. We are constantly worrying about Elisabet’s epilepsy. But despite all the worry we try to have as much fun as we can.</p><p>While being a warrior this Wednesday, Elisabet and other Syngap kids/families are in war every other day of the week too. Asking for donations and sharing your most personal story is never easy, but its my duty to help my daughter and others like her as they can’t fight for themselves. I’m proud to do it and I am proud to keep Estonia on the map.<br></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Steven was diagnosed at 15 months old (May 12, 2020) with SynGAP1 mutation after getting whole exome sequencing at the beginning of the year following a normal MRI. &nbsp; Steven has global developmental delays including delayed gross motor, fine motor, language and learning skills.&nbsp; He has oral aversions and difficulty swallowing.&nbsp; He also has extreme difficulties sleeping at night.&nbsp; He does not sleep more than 4-5 hours a night and sometimes he can have a lot of difficulty falling asleep to take a nap.</p><p>Steven loves water, animals and being outside—he loves going outside no matter the time of day or night! Bath time, swimming, splashing in the soapy dish water are all so much fun for Steven. He is a lucky boy and has two cats and two dogs in his house and he will vocalize at them and loves pushing his forehead into them to show them love.&nbsp; He is overly sensitive to the wind though and will often have an exaggerated reflex to the feel of the wind on his skin.</p><p>He is very social and can be quite loud when he gets excited.&nbsp; His smile spreads from cheek to cheek. Steven does not have words yet, but he does make several sounds to indicate his many emotions. One of his special Syngapian powers is his ability to communicate with just a look.</p><p>Steven’s absolute favorite person is his older brother Tyler. Tyler and Steven love to play peek-a-boo. Steven learned to stand from using the couch to look for his brother during the games they played together.</p><p>Steven is starting taking a few independent steps on his own. He is not quite walking, but our hope is with time, will walk on his own one day.&nbsp; This is a huge milestone for us.</p><p>He teaches us everyday about unconditional love, patience, and seeing the world through his eyes.&nbsp; He is perfect just like his brother and together they are going to change the world (hopefully they won’t set it on fire, because they can be thick as thieves sometimes and I wonder what kind of mischief is coming).</p><p> - Mom</p><p>Learn more about Steven in these articles by his mom.

			"full-story": "<p>Isabella was given a Syngap1 diagnosis in March of this year. She was first diagnosed with epilepsy at about 18 months. Our first clue something was off was a delay in walking despite being quite strong. I kept asking her pediatrician and he would say, “She’s a redhead, they are stubborn.” Then she started having eye rolls and flutters when she was eating. She would choke on her food.</p><p>We have tried so many meds, the ketogenic diet, and&nbsp; CBD oil. Bella was also diagnosed with Paroxysmal Tonic Upgaze, but never really treated for that as most doctors and neurologists don’t know much about it.</p><p>The neurologists kept telling us they thought she had a syndrome that hadn’t been discovered.</p><p>She has had speech therapy, occupational therapy and physical therapy off and on since her diagnosis of epilepsy. When we read the symptoms of Syngap 1 it was almost like reading a diary of her life!</p><p>Bella loves music, swimming, swinging, baby dolls, watching TV, playing outside, and riding her adaptive bike. You can’t ever go too fast for her. The faster a ride the happiest she is.</p><p>She struggles with sensory issues (SPD), talking and learning. She is very friendly, but can have horrible fits. Her “weird” sensory issue right now is licking (which drives mommy crazy). She doesn’t like transitions but once dressed for example, she is fine. She would live in Under Armour clothes if I let her.&nbsp; She isn’t potty trained which is our number one goal for 2020. She uses some sign language for communication (I was a sign language interpreter before staying home with her full time), some talking and we just got her a communication device.</p><p><br></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Melissa was born full term and hit all of her baby milestones until 9 months old, then she stagnated. She started walking at 18 months, she was not saying “mama” or “dada”. Her pediatrician insisted that everything was fine, all kids develop differently. At 34 months, our pediatrician was finally concerned and advised that Melissa receive Early Intervention. Besides her delayed speech and her occasional hand tremor, there was no hint that she had any other issues. Melissa was lovable, friendly, would play, follow commands, and make great eye contact. At 3 years old, I noticed her eyes flicker one day getting her out of the car. This was the beginning of the journey of her epilepsy diagnosis. Four different neurologists tried to pinpoint what she had, they could not identify an underlying disorder. At age 11, a neurologist diagnosed Melissa with TCS2. which causes Tuberous Sclerosis. Tuberous Sclerosis is a rare disease associated with epilepsy, development delay, and benign tumors. After several rounds of unnecessary medications that only seemed to be making Melissa worse. Finally in mid July of this year, after another genetic test, a diagnosis of SYNGAP1.</p><p>Melissa is strong willed and incredibly strong. Some of Melissa’s quirks and affections have not changed.&nbsp; Melissa continues to be picky when it comes to food. She will eat the same thing for 6 months and then she changes to something else. She is still fascinated by electronics and enjoys certain TV episodes that she can watch over and over again. When she speaks, she makes strong eye contact and she loves hugs, kisses, and any sort of physical contact from her loved ones. I’ve even seen her blow kisses to boys.</p><p>Melissa is my world and I hope that her medical team and I can help her through this difficult time in her life. She has endured so much in her 15 years of life thus far.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>For more detail on Melissa's incredible journey, </em><a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/melissas-story\" target=\"_blank\"><em>read this remarkable account by her mother</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><br></p>",

When her sister DeAna came we were nervous but she has now become the big sister.&nbsp; Devin is a fun loving child who enjoys dressing up in costumes.&nbsp; She loves school and her speech has improved tremendously she can also read which is amazing. She joined her schools cheerleading team which was a highlight and gave her a lot of confidence.&nbsp; Finally at 16 in June of 2019, we got her SynGAP diagnosis which definitely fit the bill.&nbsp; So lucky to have found a community of friends that we can share our experiences with.&nbsp; Devin is an amazing child and everyone who meets her is lucky.</p><p><br></p>",

He starting missing milestones around 2 years of age (mainly speech), and, in September 2019, he was diagnosed with severe epilepsy.</p><p>Right now, we have seizure control - through a combination of Epilim and Keppra. However, as Bear’s behaviour has worsened over the last six months (biting/pinching/kicking), we are considering adjusting his meds. He uses 2-3 word sentences, and his language is, predominantly, functional, but he is starting to develop emotional language. Bear has speech therapy once a week, and he slowly continues to improve.</p><p>Bear is the most positive, happy child, and he absolutely adores his brothers (ages 6 and 17 months). He struggles with fine motor skills and general coordination, but that never stops him from climbing, sliding, swinging, jumping and just generally taking risks. His high pain threshold is a blessing, in this regard!</p><p>Bear, like a typical Syngapian, loves being in water, riding horses and watching an iPad. He is extremely willful, and a runner, which can be challenging. His sleep is poor, and he often wakes at night. Appetite-wise, he will either eat a lot or nothing at all.</p><p>We love Bear to pieces, and he is adored by all who know him. With his beautiful smile, and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes, he has all our family and friends wrapped around his little finger! We will continue to fight for him, and all our Syngapians, so that they can lead the fullest of lives.”<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/katrien.deckers.3?__cft__[0]=AZVnq-4VJ-BzHGYQhAjfHbOtPO0C6SZ6ZxUZR6xCS-NYXr8MMd9QwCcqS1xCGTVUz9KWzpNTP-zDXUSjxJvvZ_KHjeXdG0rm3eiNocxYT3eL7j5y8zD59YwFN41LNr-cY-pruMRs5rWjNHk-7xe1Roof&__tn__=-]K-R\"> </a></p><p>-Mom</p>",

			"full-story": "<p>We discovered Ari had global developmental delay at 18 months and started OT, PT, and Speech Therapy shortly after. Although his learning pace is far behind other kids he progresses every day. He is an adorable kid that everyone loves when they first meet him. Ari has not been given an autism diagnosis. His therapists have said his social skills are the best among all of his skill sets.</p><p>We knew there was better explanation to his delays, soon we realized that he was having seizures. He had an EEG and genetic testing done, which confirmed our suspicions. Ari was finally diagnosed with Syngap1 just 12 days before his 4th birthday.</p><p>After all of these years we learned to focus on what he CAN do instead of what he cannot. Ari is always a happy boy, he loves music, water, and loves seeing trains. He is a sensitive boy that can feel our love and responds to it. Ari is our little angel that comes to heal us and teach us what true love is.</p><p>Getting the Syngap1 diagnosis from the doctor may have been one of the worst days of our lives but then our days have only gotten better as we have been able to see him progressing and improving day after day. He will only get better. - Mom</p><p><br></p>",

We discovered Sara’s epilepsy when she was 7, she has eyelid myoclonia now under control with Depakin. Sara has medium-severe cognitive delays, light sleep disturbances (she takes Melatonin), behavioral problem, and \"clumsy\" and uncoordinated movements, especially in fine motor skills.</p><p>Sara has a 12-year-old brother named Matteo, whom she adores, he is the only one who can make her play the way she likes. Sara is a cheerful and very happy child, she loves cuddles especially those of her father and loves physical contact. She goes to school, loves being with her friends and looks for them often, she is very communicative and sociable. Sara is able to communicate with are 3-4 word sentences and it is a great success for her.</p><p>Sara loves being active and especially loves swimming. She water and the sea very much and is good at going underwater with goggles. Sara enjoys riding her scooter whenever she can. Sara loves animals, especially dogs. She does hippotherapy with her horse Adamisio. Sara loves books, puzzles, music, and similar to most, her tablet, and TV.</p><p>Sara is a very determined child and does not give up easily. Unfortunately, she often has fits of anger, especially because she does not accept the rules and the word “no”. Then the frustration is unleashed in her that she vents with aggressive-oppositional behavior, pulls her hair, scratches, sometimes she bites, throws or throws things on the ground (chairs, bags, markers, books, etc.).</p><p>It is difficult and very demanding to live with a child with SYNGAP1. Everyday, every moment puts a strain on your patience. But Sara tries hard to learn and make progress because she is a little warrior. Everyday she amazes us with what she can do, and for us parents they are great achievements. We love her immensely as she is, she couldn't be more \"perfect\".</p><p>- Simona Alessandro and brother Matteo.<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/simona.viticchi?__cft__[0]=AZXZ7CyHsj_O374xiaIuwDL1GXJODA1ymGIUo8q_ho4sDjy7_3PBymeA9aEAj4Q1xkrmhEmDs8kokw2Cul4rTrs0zNwQRwQyJ6yXs55ayVxnGav9ARQfW9A6v3lZpgMD-nYUQ8gzBrmKV25W8rNP1V7ncGfHT5QTCh2gcA1ohx26DqK1WKJyu-Z4NUgEPXakhWE&__tn__=-]K-R\"></a></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>The best word to describe Hannah is silly. She's a funny, curious, stubborn, impulsive and playful 3½ year old. We started noticing delays around 4-5 months old and thought she may have Cerebral Palsy. It wasn’t until age 2½ that Hannah was finally diagnosed with a mosaic form of SYNGAP1 via Ambry Genetics Neurodevelopment expanded panel. Mosaic means some of her cells are healthy and some have the “de novo” SYNGAP1 mutation. Her doctors say mosaicism probably explains why she can talk and we hope it may offer protection against developing epilepsy. A month prior to Hannah’s SYNGAP1 genetic diagnosis she was diagnosed with ASD, speech delay, and gross motor delay.</p><p>Hannah loves music, reading, swimming, playdough, bubbles, sand, and board games. Her favourite foods are cupcakes, pine nuts and ice lollies. Hannah would live in the park if she could and can now swing on the “big girl” swings. She also loves the supermarket.</p><p>Hannah knows her alphabet, numbers, animals, colours, shapes and some American Sign Language. She’s starting to “read” by herself and loves Pete the Cat and Stanley books. Hannah’s visual recall is really good. Pre-COVID Hannah was able to spot her favourite book in a crowded library by glimpsing a tiny part of the spine.</p><p>Hannah sometimes refers to herself and other people as “bear.” We have no idea why!</p><p>Hannah has a little brother “Al”. She doesn’t interact with him much but likes to rub his hair and say “don’t do that, bear!” when he’s getting into mischief.</p><p>Hannah struggles to understand abstract concepts like me/you, past/present and danger. Playing with other children and pretend play is also challenging. Hannah prefers predictable interactions and will say the same jokes and phrases every day. Hannah’s attention span is limited and she needs lots of time to process a question. We are thankful that Hannah now sleeps quite well, generally all night and a 2-3 hour nap daily.</p><p>Hannah attends a wonderful developmental preschool and receives OT, PT, and Speech three times a week each at school. Having a SYNGAP1 diagnosis helps inform the best way to manage her care. We hope in the future SYNGAP1 will be tested for at birth and gene-specific therapies will be found to help mitigate the serious challenges the children face.&nbsp;</p><p>-Jessica, Mom<br></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Ryan was diagnosed with Syngap1 in November of 2020 at UMC Utrecht. We stopped searching for a cause years ago, but insurance wise it was logical to do exome&nbsp; sequencing once more before his 18th birthday. Bingo.</p><p>He was born healthy (we thought) in 2003. After 6 months we noticed that he was not developing at the usual rate. At 11 months, we had a “circus” of tests done, no cause was found. He was diagnosed with global developmental delay. At 2.5 years, he just started walking but we noticed that he fell a lot. An EEG was done and showed that Ryan was having seizures, thus an epilepsy diagnosis. At this point we started experimenting with one drug after another, alternative methods, and finally at the age of 4 we started the ketogenic diet and he became 100% seizure free. I thought we won the battle.</p><p>Ryan started at a special needs school but we were advised that he would do better elsewhere. At this time his frustration was growing, not being able to communicate led to aggression (biting, scratching, and hair pulling). After much research we found ABA. At the time ABA was not a big thing in Holland (still isn’t). But I found one ABA school in another part of Holland. We sold our house, found new jobs and moved there. After 18 months his seizures came back and he had a prolonged QT interval of his heart, a rare side effect of the diet. Ryan then had a NVS implanted and we tried CBD oil - all in which did not work for him. We no longer have tried to treat his epilepsy. Eventually Ryan faded out of his ABA school so we transitioned him to a special needs school in the area in which he is thriving.</p><p>He has about everything on the Syngap1 list: constant epileptic activity, autism, sleepless nights, dyspraxia, teeth grinding, and aggressive behaviors. Ryan is extremely determined. When it is his will against yours, you will lose. Punishment never works. Positive bribery does. Mentally he is like a 2 year old. With years and years of ABA, horse therapy, music therapy, aquatherapy, speech therapy, dolphin therapy we have reached wonders behavioral wise. Often he is still very aggressive, which can be difficult due to his size.</p><p>Fortunately, most of the time he is easy to handle. He is the happiest kid I know. Very affectionate with family, most of all with his 16 year old brother William. Because he is happy and laughs a lot, people always&nbsp; instantly fall in love with him.</p><p>The last five years we mainly focus on behavior, following instructions and flexibility. He understands simple instructions and knows some sign language to tell us what he wants.&nbsp; We have a great team of aids working with him. They also come along on family holidays.</p><p>Ryan loves exciting things: fire, thunder and lightning, heavy rain, roller coasters. He isn’t afraid of anything. Only of barking dogs. The minute he sees a dog he puts his hands over his ears and starts panicking. But he loves dogs as well. He also loves sea lions, goats, and horses. It is pretty amazing to see how he connects with these animals.<br></p>",

I enjoy special olympics (basketball, flag football, and track), school, church, college football and basketball, collecting college mascots, video games, and Pokemon Go.” When asked what he would want other kids who have disabilities to know he said, “with disabilities you are different from others. It is okay, it makes you special.”</p><p>In April of 2020 after his first grand mal seizure, Patrick was diagnosed with Syngap1. After over 15 years of searching, I’m still wrapping my head around the fact we finally have an answer.</p><p>Patrick is a warrior in every sense. He is truly the bravest and toughest person I know. He has a pure soul, a huge heart, and loves to help others. He is persistent, stubborn, and strong willed. Patrick loves sports and tries hard at everything he does and is a team payer who absolutely LOVES being part of a team.</p><p>From the start he has been our puzzle. For the longest time he needed much less sleep than the rest of us. He had chronic ear infections, delayed sitting, walking, and talking. Delayed enough for us to sense something was not right - but not enough to raise a red flag with doctors.</p><p>At 3.5, Patrick was diagnosed with epilepsy. He spent several days in the hospital, followed by months of testing - nothing was found. He was later diagnosed with Dyspraxia, Expressive/Receptive Language disorder, and ADHD. Thankfully his seizures were mostly very mild, hardly noticeable.</p><p>With this diagnosis we now have an answer to our questions and a sense of community.</p><p>Patrick is a junior in the Floral and Horticulture Program at our local career center. Last year, his Special Olympics basketball team was state runner up in their division (he was recognized with a varsity letter from school!). Patrick played the trombone all through middle school and marched in the band freshman year of high school. He is not afraid of anything, Patrick gives me incredible hope.<br></p>",

			"full-story": "<p>Logan is a twin, he and Danny were healthy babies born full term in Week 40. While Logan was the first to turn around, Danny progressed much faster on the other milestones. When Logan was 12 months old, he had what seemed to be a neurological event. In October 2019 after several genetic tests, Logan was diagnosed with Syngap1 who responded to his delays.</p><p>Logan is typically a happy kid who loves to be outside jumping on the trampoline (while other kids bounce him), loves being pushed on a swing and taking tractor and road rides. He loves people, especially adults, and is super generous with his hugs. He hasn't met a stranger who doesn't like him. Logan is obsessed with phone calls, FaceTiming and selfie mode. He loves buttons and switches and seeing the resulting effects of seeing the lights on and off or the garage door open and shut. And he loves the attention of his brothers.</p><p>Logan is known in his preschool church and community for his generous hugs, big smile and fun and numerous facial expressions.</p><p>Logan has been in physical therapy, occupational therapy and language therapies since he was one year old. He's come a long way to grab and carry items. Still doesn't run but can walk real fast. She still prefers bottles, but she's learning to eat solid foods. Logan can say some words like ′′ dad ′′ and ′′ baba ′′ (bottle). She babbles a lot, but she's still working to learn how to speak. He gets frustrated when he can't communicate his needs or desires, and that frustration results in shouting and crying. He can definitely understand a lot more than he can articulate.</p><p>Unlike many other Syngapians, Logan is not epileptic and has no autism. He doesn't take any medication.</p><p>Logan brings lots of joy to his family and friends!</p><p>Thanks for reading Logan's story! Check out all our Warrior Wednesday posts.</p>",

			"full-story": "<p>“Paul was diagnosed in 2014 at the Necker Hospital's Imagine Institute in Paris. Paul is my second child and I immediately felt he was delayed in all his milestones. He started eating food from a spoon at 12 months old, crawled at 24 Months and took his first steps at 3 years old. Today he can run, ride his tricycle, ski and ride horses.</p><p>He is potty trained and no longer wears diapers for 6 months now. He loves drawing, looking at books but his favorite is to watch cartoons, especially Paw Patrol, Peppa Pig and Scoobidoo and Youtube on the Ipad. He can say a few words and also begins to read basic words. He mainly communicates using signed Makaton, also practiced at his Institute.</p><p>Despite a few absence seizures, he is not receiving any treatment for epilepsy.</p><p>Paul has a hard time managing his frustrations and transitions can be difficult. He gets mad easily (sometimes with aggressive behaviors toward us) and depending on the situation, he can be difficult to control. After his crisis, he feels bad and come to us for forgiveness because Paul loves hugs and kisses (giving and receiving). He can also have obsessions (at the moment he loves watching &nbsp;automatic parking gates videos on youtube). Paul is very loving and determined to keep making progress and the difficult moments are easily forgotten.”</p><p>‍</p>",
