		"Full Story": "<p>Kimberley has 2 older siblings who love her dearly and are so patient and understanding. She still has a big impact on them as they’ve had to learn extra patience.</p><p>We noticed Kimberley showing signs of delays from 6 months old as she didn’t crawl, sit up until much later without support as well as late walking and never babbled.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Kimberley was diagnosed in 2013 with global developmental delays as she had no speech. She showed behavior problems such as, aggression, self harm (biting, hitting her head).<br></p><p>After 4 years of being in the unknown we received our SYNGAP1 diagnosis in March of 2020.&nbsp; We received this diagnosis from 100,000 genomes project genetic testing.<br></p><p>Kimberley suffers with sleep disturbances. We give her melatonin but she still wakes up most nights and stays awake. Her brain just does not seem to want to shut off. She is still in diapers. She has limited speech, on her best days she says around 8 words. She has obsessions that can lead to extreme frustration. If she is on her iPad (watching ambulances or blippi) and it suddenly switches off she will go into a rage. Kimberley has a high pain tolerance. She has no danger awareness so she has to have 1:1 care at all times. She thrives from routine and familiar settings, shows aggressive outbursts when there is change. Currently she is showing absence and myoclonic seizures but we are currently waiting on an EEG for further testing.<br></p><p>She attends a Special Educational Needs (SEN) school which she loves going to. Kimberley loves music ,dancing ,horse riding, being outside whatever the weather. Most of all, she loves water, a true Syngapian.<br></p><p>Kimberley is the most determined little girl I know, she can be very affectionate and happy. We all love her so very much.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Having a SYNGAP1 diagnosis was tough to hear but we have the best support from other families like ours were a huge SYNGAP1 family I don’t know where we’d be without them.<br></p>"

		"Full Story": "<p>Krisstine is an active and rambunctious 6-year-old (7 in December) kid! After many doctors' appointments, she was diagnosed with SynGap1 in August of 2016 @ Texas Children's Hospital.<br><br>She is currently being treated for Epilepsy, Global Developmental Delay, and Autism and while she doesn't speak much she manages to get her point across with her very expressive facial expressions.<br><br>In our family, she is called, \"The Boss\" and it is her world, we are just living in it. In addition to her mother and father, she has two older siblings that adore her as well.<br><br>She attends ABA full time as well as other therapies. Before ABA she attended a specialty school here in Houston, but we felt that ABA was her best option moving forward. We can't recommend it enough. ABA is helping her deal with her frustrations and inability to sometimes communicate what she needs or wants. &nbsp;When she's not in school she likes to swim, climb to high places, and watch bubble guppies.”<br></p><p>‍</p>"

		"Full Story": "<p>Kyle was diagnosed with SYNGAP1 in July of 2020. We honestly didn't think we would ever receive a diagnosis that would explain all of Kyle's symptoms. He had had several genetic tests (with negative results) when he was younger, but SYNGAP1 had only been discovered when Kyle was just three years old, so he was never tested for this genetic disorder until last summer, when his neurologist and geneticist suggested that we test again. Kyle has hypotonia and didn't walk independently until he was 3 years old. He is nonverbal, but uses a few signs as well as a Speech Generating Device, to communicate basic needs and wants. He is not yet potty trained, but we are currently working hard on teaching him. Kyle has atonic seizures and the onset of his epilepsy was just before his 2nd Birthday. Kyle has had speech, occupational, and physical therapies since he was a few months old. He has also participated in Hippotheraphy, which he loved. He attends a private school for children with special needs where ABA Therapy is used. Kyle loves to look at books, loves attention and cuddling, has an amazing memory, and the most contagious laughter!&nbsp;<br></p><p>We love spending time together, but the focus tends to need to be on our Syngapian in order for all of us to have a good time! Kyle loves swimming, going to playgrounds, and taking rides on elevators and on our golf cart. He also loves covered bridges, so our family has visited quite a few in our area. When Kyle is doing any of these things, he experiences pure joy.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Kyle needs full assistance and care 24/7 and, at times, my husband and I are overwhelmed, emotionally, not sure of what his future will look like. We hope that he continues to progress with his speech device so that he can communicate even more with us. We are excited to finally have a diagnosis so that we can connect with other Syngap families and learn from them, but also to help other families who have children who are younger and recently diagnosed.&nbsp;<br></p><p>I would tell newly diagnosed families to connect with others who have children with Syngap for support and hope, and advice on various things (such as potty training, communication, therapies, etc.) I would tell them that their life is going to have challenges and difficulties, but also much joy and happiness. If they not only focus on their child and the support he or she needs, but also to focus on themselves and get the support they need as the parents and caregivers of their Syngapian.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Kyle’s mother Kelli has a wonderful website where she writes and shares videos of Kyle to encourage other parents and remind them that they are not alone: <a href=\"http://www.KelliMcIntosh.com\">KelliMcIntosh.com</a></p><p>Kelli has also been sharing videos about her son which we urge you to watch: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkuUMttDLfk\" target=\"_blank\">What is Syngap1?</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO_5904e54M\" target=\"_blank\">SYNGAP1 Morning Routine</a>.<br></p>"
