    "Post Body": "<p><em>Ever since SRF&nbsp;was created, we have received numerous requests to support Natural History Studies. They were all expensive and too slow. When we saw Ciitizen, we knew we had made a good decision by insisting on a better option and doing a tremendous amount of research. We are proud of our choice in Ciitizen to host our digital Natural History Study. Based on questions from other Rare Disease groups who are making the same choice and questions from our community members, we are sharing the most succinct summary of our logic here. In addition to the below, we urge you to read previous articles by </em><a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/dociitizen\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Virginie</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/ciitizen-a-major-service\" target=\"_blank\"><em>JR</em></a><em> as well as this </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjpr3a14_ls26T1_qecZt_frWW2chSM1-\" target=\"_blank\"><em>set of videos on YouTube</em></a><em>. </em></p><p><em>If you have any questions or want to find out more, please reach out to anyone on the </em><a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/home/our-team/meet-the-team-board-of-directors\"><em>SRF Board</em></a><em>. Thank you for sharing your data with Ciitizen, it will help all of loved ones with this disease. Sign up now </em><a href=\"http://Ciitizen.com/SYNGAP1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Ciitizen.com/SYNGAP1.</em></a></p><p><em>-</em><a href=\"http://syngap.fund/mike\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mike</em></a></p><p>‍</p><h4>The patient is in control &amp; they immediately benefit</h4><p>1. Ciitizen is a patient-centric platform that was created when the founder, Anil Sethi, lost his younger sister to breast cancer. Anil built Ciitizen with the patient in mind. He had just spent the final six months of her life seeing what a mess medical records were and how much data was not being used to cure disease. This is why he ensured that patients are in control. Patients (or their caregivers) &nbsp;consent to be on the platform and join the NHS. The medical records that Ciitizen retrieves belong solely and wholly to the patient.</p><p>Indeed, unlike any other registry we are aware of, Ciitizen gives the patient full access to their information at all times. So as soon as the caregiver signs up they have a portal where they can request more records and see what is already collected. They are also able to share these records at will. This is very helpful when caring for a medically complex child.</p><p>‍</p><h4>The Ciitizen team is world class</h4><p>2. The PI on this NHS is <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elli-brimble-82774798/\" target=\"_blank\">Elli Brimble</a>, head of clinical operations at Ciitizen. Elli is a certified medical genetic counselor who sits on the SRF Scientific Advisory Board. She has seen SYNGAP patients in the clinic. The Ciitizen's Chief Regulatory Officer is <a href=\"https://www.ciitizen.com/privacypolicy/\" target=\"_blank\">Deven McGraw</a>, former Deputy Director for the Office for Civil Rights under the Obama administration, and author of many of the patient HIPAA laws we use today. The CEO, Anil, before his sister fell sick, <a href=\"https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2018/07/former-apple-health-director-who-sold-his-company-gliimpse-to-apple-is-on-a-mission-to-fix-medical-record-systems.html\" target=\"_blank\">sold a company to Apple</a> which became Apple Health Records. &nbsp;The head of Rare Disease at Ciitizen is <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elli-brimble-82774798/\" target=\"_blank\">Nasha Fitter</a>, founder of FOXG1 Research Foundation and a rare parent, just like us. She joined this company to make sure that Ciitizen was available to rare patients. <a href=\"https://www.ciitizen.com/the-rare-disease-crusaders/\" target=\"_blank\">Her blog about this work</a> is worth your time. The list goes on but, we are certain that this team could not be stronger.</p><p>‍</p><h4>This NHS is vetted, secure, &amp; IRB approved </h4><p>3. The Syngap1 NHS has been approved by a central IRB (<a href=\"https://www.pearlirb.com\">Pearl</a>) as clearly indicated in the consent.</p><p>‍</p><h4>The data is freely available to researchers</h4><p>4. The data that is extracted from Syngap1 patient medical records is available free of cost to all academic researchers and non-profit organizations. We have presented the Ciitizen platform to various Syngap clinicians and there has been clear excitement to have this data available. This is because it will save them months if not years of work, this is time they can spend working on our disease. This is time our patients won't have to wait for a treatment.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Ciitizen is giving SRF&nbsp;a great deal, which allows us to make it free for families</h4><p>5. Ciitizen has charged SRF a small fraction of what it actually costs to even do the work of collecting all medical records and images and creating our NHS. As a result SRF is able to absorb the cost and invite all families to participate at no cost.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Biotechs will be glad to license the anonymized data </h4><p>6. In order to keep Ciitizen free for patients and nominal for advocacy groups, Ciitizen charges commercial entities only a license fee. This fee is lower than if these commercial entities established their own NHS, as it is Ciitizen's goal to make data on rare diseases more available and entice more companies to focus on Syngap1. It's also faster since the Ciitizen data is ready to go but traditional studies will take at least a year. Even better, Ciitizen shares a % of any licensing fee back to SRF so we can continue investing in basic research. &nbsp;Like all donations to SRF, 100% of these funds will go to research and data.</p><p>‍</p><h4>This approach is easier on patients</h4><p>7. The Ciitizen NHS is a global, digital NHS. This means that patients do not need to travel to academic sites to take tests they have likely already received in the course of their treatment. </p><p>‍</p><h4>Ciitizen is global</h4><p>8. In 2020, we launched in the United States, and will expand internationally in 2021. This means that we will be able to accept medical records in English from any country. If you are in the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India or any other country where medical records are kept in English, please reach out to us to be included in the International rollout. We are currently looking into translation solutions for other countries now.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Ciitizen is fast</h4><p>9. We began this work with Ciitizen in September. By early next year, we will have a Natural History for 100 Syngap patients complete. This is the fastest that any rare disease group has been able to accomplish a study of this size and quality. This work will help us understand our disease to make better day-to-day care decisions for our children, help our academic researchers further their work, and entice biopharma to focus on SYNGAP1.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Time is Brain</h4><p>10. My son will turn 7 next week. He was diagnosed when he was 4. I'm hopeful that by the time he is 10 there will be therapies we can use to increase the SYNGAP&nbsp;in his brain and therefore reduce his suffering--his seizures, his behaviors, his broken sleep, his confusion, his biting, his uncertain future, and so much more that keeps me up at night. I cannot fathom that when that therapy is ready, we would have to wait another year or two so that we could do a study of the population to see what we have to measure. As a SYNGAP community the one thing we are uniquely poised to do, empowered by a partnership with Ciitizen and the donors of SRF, is to organize our patient data and make sure that we help our children as fast as possible.

A total of 221 known families were identified this past year. That's more patients found this year (despite a raging global pandemic) than the count we started with at the beginning of 2019. We’re averaging 57 new patients worldwide per quarter.&nbsp;</p><p>This number matters. Companies invest in drugs based on numbers of patients diagnosed and how fast they are being found. We urge everyone to <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/contact-us\" target=\"_blank\">reach out to SRF</a> or any of our partners in SGN and make sure we have you counted. If your family member with SYNGAP1 is currently resident in the US, we encourage you to participate in <a href=\"http://www.ciitizen.com/syngap1\" target=\"_blank\">Ciitizen</a>, SRF's patient registry, and poised to be the largest SynGAP natural history study ever conducted. Also, please put a pin on the SGN <a href=\"https://www.syngap1.me/\" target=\"_blank\">SynGAP Map</a> to see which families might be close to you.</p><p>‍</p><h4>WHERE DID WE FIND MORE PATIENTS?</h4><p>The summary data is in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oJwMysR2wyTxe91zLlKJglNa0NySPxkBF0PRiV6mBmM/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">this Google Sheet</a>. In Q4 we added 11 in the USA, and 4 in the UK. Our partner groups in key countries help us keep the #SynGAPCensus straight: the story of the year is the explosion in connected families in China (up 17) which has been facilitated by the incredible growth of Syngap China.&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.overcomesyngap1.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Overcôme Syngap</a> identified 6 in France and 1 in Canada. Syngap Benelux also found 6. &nbsp;<a href=\"http://syngap.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Syngap Elternhilfe</a> identified 5 in Germany.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.syngapaustralia.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Syngap Research Fund Australia</a> found 2.&nbsp; Syngap Sweden found 1.</p><p>In countries without organizations it is harder to find people and if you are a parent in a country that does not have a group, please start one.&nbsp; (Lots of other good reasons to have one besides counting, please let us know how we can help.) By way of the ever-supportive <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SyngapResearchFund\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> group and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/fondodeinvestigacionsyngap\" target=\"_blank\">Fondo De Investigación SynGAP</a> we also found 4 more SynGAPians in Hong Kong, Egypt, and Chile.</p><p>‍</p><h4>THESE NUMBERS ARE STILL TOO LOW</h4><p>It's dreadful to ponder how many people out in the world with SYNGAP1 remain undiagnosed. Time after time, families tell us that diagnosis has helped them understand their child better and helped them plan for their future. Parents of newly diagnosed children have described connecting with local Syngap groups “as lightning in dark clouds”. We ask every family to do whatever they feel comfortable with in terms of spreading awareness of SYNGAP1. It might be simply mentioning SRF to a neurologist or physician, it could be writing or sharing an article with your home country's epilepsy organization, or sharing their child's story on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/syngapfund/\" target=\"_blank\">Warrior Wednesday</a>, or posting a link to programs like <a href=\"https://www.invitae.com/en/behindtheseizure/\" target=\"_blank\">Behind the Seizure</a> in an epilepsy or special needs forum. We appreciate the 2020 count sadly missing far too many children and adults around the world. Sharing our stories is one of the most powerful things we can do to spread awareness and find more families.</p><p>Be well. May 2021 bring us both closer to a treatment and closer to one another.&nbsp;<br></p>",

    "Post Body": "<p>When your child is diagnosed with a rare, devastating neuro-developmental disorder — one with only <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/3q20\" target=\"_blank\">648</a> patients diagnosed globally, and no treatment or cure — you’re immediately taken to a very dark place. But then you get home, and you scour the internet, and you quickly find <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SyngapResearchFund\" target=\"_blank\">patient support groups</a> via Facebook. </p><p>And you realize that the majority of these families are connected and share a unique and common bond: the hardships and joys in raising a Syngapian. In this day and age, the natural question is <em>“Why is there no treatment yet?”</em> &nbsp;It is the right question. &nbsp;The answer is research costs money and for a rare disease, there aren’t enough patients to justify public investment, so it falls to the families.</p><p>We as a community have the ability to collectively accelerate the path to treatment for our children. &nbsp;We can raise the funds to focus more researchers on SYNGAP1. &nbsp;But how to do that? &nbsp;Give a gift to my local university? &nbsp;How about a grant to an existing researcher? &nbsp;Should we invest in something like a drug screen that might help a bit in a few years, or something sci-fi like prime editing that could cure our kids in a few more years? &nbsp;The questions are endless.</p><p>The best way to move the needle for SYNGAP is pool our funds in an organization that primarily exists for the purpose of doing exactly that. &nbsp;There are multiple organizations in the SYNGAP space, so which one to work with?</p><p>Here are seven reasons our family supports SRF—as both volunteers &amp; donors—and you should too:</p><ol><li>LASER FOCUS ON SCIENCE</li><li>ZERO OVERHEAD: EVERY PENNY YOU DONATE GOES TO SCIENCE</li><li>FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE GLOBAL SYNGAP NETWORK</li><li>FULL-TIME DEDICATED MANAGEMENT </li><li>SAB IS AN ENGAGED TEAM OF TOP-SHELF SCIENTIFIC ADVISORS</li><li>A PARENT TEAM OF DOCTORS &amp; SCIENTISTS</li><li>SMART PORTFOLIO APPROACH</li></ol><p>Let me flesh those out:</p><ol><li>SRF HAS A LASER FOCUS ON SCIENCE<br>SRF was created to accelerate the science—it is why we exist. &nbsp;SRF wrote &amp; funded three grants in the year it was created. &nbsp;Read the blogs (Ashley’s <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/cure\" target=\"_blank\">article on a cure</a> is a good start) and review the webinars, this organization is focused. &nbsp;As of now, SRF has granted over $1,000,000 to scientists. &nbsp;Not bad for a 2 1/2 year old organization.</li><li>SRF IS ZERO OVERHEAD: EVERY PENNY YOU DONATE TO SRF GOES TO SCIENCE<br>Organizations have expenses. &nbsp;Websites. Accountants. Lawyers. Printing. Mailing. Travel. etc. &nbsp;Whenever you give to an organization it’s important to understand how much money is “feeding the beast” of the org and how much is doing something you care about. &nbsp;Since the founders initially conceived SRF as an aggregator of funds for research, the founders decided this number should be as low as possible: they designed a lean virtual organization run by parent volunteers with very low costs. &nbsp;They then set aside funds to cover all the operating costs of SRF, so that every donor could be sure, <em>100% of funds entrusted to SRF will go to a lab or research project</em>.</li><li>SRF IS A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE GLOBAL SYNGAP NETWORK<br>SRF a founding member (and the only American member) organization of Syngap Global Network (SGN). &nbsp;This global consortium of Syngap organizations are constantly collaborating to achieve common goals. SGN collectively tracks and prioritizes all research projects to both ensure no duplicative efforts &amp; to identify all opportunities for collaboration.</li><li>SRF HAS FULL-TIME DEDICATED MANAGEMENT WORKING WITH PROFESSIONAL PARENTS<br>Our founder left his job at the start of 2020 to run SRF full time as the managing director. This is good news for SRF since Mike’s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/graglia/\" target=\"_blank\">path</a> has been a strong preparation for running a rare disease organization. &nbsp;Mike’s experience in healthcare as a consultant, in grant making at major institutions, as well as other roles where had to meet constant challenges all inform how he pushes SRF forward every day. &nbsp;That skill set is valuable and free for SRF. <br>In addition the board of SRF is composed of strictly parents who represent a dozen SynGAP families. &nbsp;These Directors of SRF all volunteer their time to ensure SRF stays focused on making progress with science for our kids. </li><li>SRF SAB IS AN ENGAGED TEAM OF TOP-SHELF SCIENTIFIC ADVISORS<br>The scientific advisory board of SRF is a carefully curated and intentionally small group of remarkable scientists. &nbsp;We don’t know where the next breakthrough will be nor what specific technology will drive it. &nbsp;But when the question arrives, this SAB has the knowledge and network to make sure SRF gets a good answer.</li><li>SRF HAS A PARENT TEAM OF DOCTORS &amp; SCIENTISTS<br>In addition to the SAB and constant engagement with biotech &amp; pharma, SRF has built a team of parents who all have advanced training in medicine or science. &nbsp;The SRF MedSci team has three MDs, three doctorates, a veterinarian &amp; some nurses who meet every month and pour through the research through the lens of a parent. &nbsp;This team is exactly who you want to be working with the scientists we are funding.</li><li>SRF TAKES A SMART PORTFOLIO APPROACH<br>There are multiple paths to treatment for genetic conditions like Syngap: small molecules, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), AAVs (gene editing), etc. SRF has strategically diversified their investments across multiple labs pursuing multiple techniques (nearly $1M to-date) to allow for the highest likelihood of identifying novel therapies to serve a broad patient population.<br>Smarter still, SRF realized that with all the research they are tracking, it wasn’t clear who would get out of the lab and into the clinic faster. &nbsp;But they will all need to complete clinical trails to get there. &nbsp;This is why SRF has made a meaningful investment in building a <a href=\"http://ciitizen.com/syngap1\" target=\"_blank\">digital natural history study</a> in partnership with ciitizen—this data will help whomever decides to do a clinical trail move faster. &nbsp;All parents should sign up for ciitizen (click here <a href=\"http://ciitizen.com/syngap1)\">http://ciitizen.com/syngap1)</a> , we are lucky to have it.</li></ol><p>SRF is remarkable, so much so that the Rare Film Festival made a film about it. &nbsp;Please watch it here, and then join me in supporting the Syngap Research Fund. Together, we can significantly change the trajectory, and improve the quality of life, for our children.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%\"><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GTPK5C5kx3Q\"></iframe></div></figure><p></p><p></p>",

    "Post Body": "<p><em>Ashley Evans’s son, Tony, was diagnosed with SynGAP1 in 2018, and she is the co-founder and Chair of the Board of Directors of SRF.</em></p><p>I will say to you what my kindest friends said to me when I lost my parents, and again when my son Tony was diagnosed with epilepsy, and then SynGAP1:</p><p><em>I am sorry. And, welcome to the club.</em></p><p>This is not a club that you would have chosen to join — in fact, you probably would have chosen to have a SynGAP1 diagnosis yourself rather than see your precious child suffer — but it is a group of hundreds of parents who uniquely understand the particular form of suffering you experience in watching your sweet child struggle to learn, and sometimes rage, try to make a friend, to not sleep on exactly the night when you needed to sleep most, and sometimes laugh in the sweetest tones you have ever heard…</p><p>As one such parent, I am including here the most succinct amalgam of advice I can offer, today, a year into the diagnosis and five years into my son’s life. My “<strong>SynGAP1 Top 10</strong>” advice list of things I wish I had known earlier is ordered from the most practical &amp; tactical to the more strategic &amp; theoretical. I hope it is helpful to you.</p><p><strong>1 — Get an EEG, early and often</strong>. SynGAP-1 seizures can be subtle, but most patients suffer from epilepsy beginning around the age of 3, or earlier. We have seen multiple patients (including our son) have a normal-ish EEG, and then start to show odd eyelid flutters (often induced by oral stimulation), that, upon later EEG analysis, revealed multiple seizures per hour.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.25%\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qxG0Rxo3Qvk?wmode=opaque&enablejsapi=1\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></figure><p><strong>2 — Try a variety of epilepsy treatments.</strong></p><p>Some patients have had success with Onfi (Clobazam), others with Lamictal, and others with other drugs. For Tony, we tried both Onfi and Lamictal, but these did not eliminate the seizures and also resulted in very negative side effects. For us, it has been a combination of the <a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/treating-seizures-and-epilepsy/dietary-therapies/ketogenic-diet\" target=\"_blank\">ketogenic</a> diet and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@syngapfund/how-we-got-started-with-cbd-f517f6f04642\" target=\"_blank\">CBD oil</a> that have controlled the seizures (so far), and also somewhat managed his behaviors, but this has taken 24 months, and we expect it to change again as he grows.</p><p><strong>3 — Get a sleep study.</strong></p><p>Because our children are low tone, they can easily develop sleep apnea, and a tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (a relatively straightforward surgery) can reduce sleep apnea symptoms. This surgery will not be a cure-all for sleep issues, but if your child’s tonsil’s are enlarged, removing them may help them sometimes sleep better on the margin. <a href=\"https://medium.com/@syngapfund/syngap-sleep-you-could-be-one-more-test-away-from-helping-your-syngapian-thrive-94d4dad68cdb\" target=\"_blank\">Read more about our experience here</a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>4 — Get help anywhere you can find it</strong>.</p><p>If you are in the US, apply to your local government agency (in California we call them Regional Centers) definitely before the age of 18, and use the services they offer. Seek an autism diagnosis, as this is a key diagnosis required to receive behavioral therapy. Get an IEP (individualized education plan) or the international equivalent, and advocate for the school to find ways to educate your child and support you with challenging behaviors (potty training is fair game!). If you find your state does not offer appropriate help for your child, you would not be the first to consider a relocation.</p><p><strong>5 — Seek out therapies for your child.</strong></p><p>While therapy may be hard to access (see above), and while some therapists are not going to be overwhelmed by the array of challenges that synGAP-1 is (our first physical therapist induced several seizures), it is worthwhile to advocate for therapy and find supportive speech therapists (STs), occupational therapists (OTs), physical therapists (PTs), horse therapists, behavioral therapists (ABAs or BCBAs), etc. All the evidence I have seen would suggest that synGAP-1 children, like all children, want to learn and grow, and they require special attention to do so effectively. They tend to have pretty incredible memories (though these memories can be hard to access / reveal) and enjoy succeeding. My son Tony refers to his therapists as his “friends.”</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"Tony getting Equine Therapy at Square Peg Foundation in Half Moon Bay, CA.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7b33f59b3f3817658731b_WelcomeLetter1.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Tony getting Equine Therapy at Square Peg Foundation in Half Moon Bay, CA.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>6 — Remember, you are not alone.</strong></p><p>It may not feel like it on any number of sleepless nights, exhausting days, but the SynGAP1 community is there for you (given the diagnosis rate, larger than any of us know) and our cousins in the broader epilepsy, autism, and ID communities are out there as well. Joining online channels can be therapeutic (to a point) and 1:1 connections can be particularly powerful — the SRF patient advocacy group is working to facilitate these communications. Finding “sensory-friendly” activities, or autism or ID groups, can help you connect with people whose challenges are not too different from yours.</p><p><strong>7 — It is OK to be angry</strong>.</p><p>Being a parent can be hard in and of itself, but being a parent of a child with this collection of special needs is particularly hard. Your child will likely have a very different life from what you would have expected, or hoped; your friends, family, and random passersby may not understand (or worse, may harshly judge) your child or you for things that are entirely out of your control. This is hard, and it is going to be harder. Don’t waste time or energy resisting the anger; harness it instead. Do something.</p><p><strong>8 — Have hope.</strong></p><p>You have a diagnosis. In fact, you have a diagnosis of a condition that is a <a href=\"https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18474\" target=\"_blank\">haplo-insufficiency</a> on a single base pair of the massive human genome — i.e., the genetic disease type that most geneticists would tell you is the most targetable of all. Though there is no treatment now, the possibility that there may be within your child’s lifetime is a very real one. It is out of this hope that we have built SRF, and it is my wish that you will share in this hope with us.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"Tony in Dumbo at Disneyland in April 2019\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7b33f7e4b2823fdc8075f_WelcomeLetter2.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Tony in Dumbo at Disneyland in April 2019</figcaption></figure><p><strong>9 — You are a SynGAP1 expert.</strong></p><p>It’s an odd feeling explaining a rare disease to an MD, a PhD or an MD/PhD, but you need to get used to it. Go in with the latest paper (<a href=\"https://medium.com/@syngapfund/syngap-patient-neurology-paper-five-things-parents-need-to-know-7910e6b95ce2\" target=\"_blank\">here’s the SRF summary</a>) and tell them they need to read up if they will have the privilege of caring for your rare child. You have spent many thousands more hours with your child than any clinician and understand this disease with more detail and nuance than any of them ever will. So, share insights and data with them, and every other researcher. Please participate in the <a href=\"http://www.ciitizen.com/syngap1/\">SRF Ciitizen Digital Natural History Study</a> which will benefit research, and help drive towards a cure.</p><p><strong>10 — You know what is best for your child.</strong></p><p>I hope that you will have lots of advisors — teachers, therapists, doctors, nurses, family members, other special needs parents — who are well-meaning and wise in their area of expertise. But you are the one who has watched your wide-eyed infant grow into the person s/he is today. So, be empowered to take the advice that you believe serves your child, and to disregard the rest.</p><p>I send you only good wishes for your journey, with the hopes that you will be wiser than me, and your path will be more straightforward, but the knowledge that this may not be the case. I hope that we will cross paths on this journey, and that we can help one another help our SynGAP1 children live their best lives.</p><p>In peace and in hope,</p><p>Ashley</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"Tony and Ashley sharing a Keto-friendly lunch.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7b33fe9a70263938b2c1a_WelcomeLetter3.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Tony and Ashley sharing a Keto-friendly lunch.</figcaption></figure><p><br></p><p>‍</p>",

    "Post Body": "<p><em>JJ Brown is a mom on a mission, SRF is grateful she has joined our tribe. &nbsp;JJ &amp; Chris have been helping non-stop since they found us. &nbsp;Sharing her story and gift for writing is just one way. JJ’s </em><a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/steven\" target=\"_blank\"><em>first blog highlights</em></a><em> Steven’s challenges and their journey around getting a diagnosis. &nbsp;In this article JJ expresses the emotions that she faces on the other side of a diagnosis.</em></p><h2><strong>COPING WITH THE DIAGNOSIS</strong></h2><p>Steven was diagnosed with a SYNGAP1 mutation just over three months ago. &nbsp;Dr. A called us the evening of May 12, 2020, for our scheduled telehealth appointment. &nbsp;After casually asking about Steven, Dr. A was ready to go home for the night. &nbsp;We remind him that the genetic test results should be complete by now (it had been 5 months) and we would like to know the results. &nbsp;After looking up the results, Dr. A informed us that Steven had a SYNGAP1 mutation and that explains his delayed development. He asked if Steven was sensitive to light and ended the call. &nbsp;He put his doctor’s coat up for the day and Chris and I were left to digest this minimal information. </p><p>We started with a simple google search while making dinner. &nbsp;“Dr.” Wikipedia’s brief explanation was enough to send our minds spinning. &nbsp;After putting the kids to bed for the night, Chris and I dove a little deeper into SYNGAP1 research. &nbsp;We spent hours talking and crying. &nbsp;It was our first night of our new life with Steven the Syngapian. &nbsp;</p><p>We have an answer and for that I am grateful. &nbsp;A simple explanation for all of Steven’s struggles, deficits, and delays. &nbsp;In our short time with the diagnosis, Steven’s day to day is not all that much different from before he was diagnosed. &nbsp;The focus has always been to aid in his development and make his daily life as rich as possible. &nbsp;His brother Tyler’s daily life became about sharing Mom and Dad with his little brother; learning how to adapt. &nbsp;And for Chris and I, since Steven was born we have been in different states of survival. &nbsp;With his diagnosis we felt that survival was all we were going to be able to do for a probably a long time. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"106075111_10223417257249803_245192062093353742_o.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb569542e87c10d1f68a889_106075111_10223417257249803_245192062093353742_o.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2><strong>ALL THE EMOTIONS</strong></h2><p>After the initial google search and the first few papers we read, we started feeling <em>all</em> the emotions. Emotions such as anger, frustration, relief, fear, grief and eventually acceptance, empowerment, and purpose.</p><p><strong><em>Anger</em>.</strong> &nbsp;I was angry with myself. I was mad at the universe. &nbsp;I did not understand why this happened to us. I was angry with the doctors. Steven has a diagnosis, but still none of his physicians understand either the basics or the complexity of syndromes caused by the lack of SynGAP. &nbsp;The burden was not lifted by getting a diagnosis. &nbsp;It is still my responsibility to be the expert on Steven and to make sure his medical needs are met. &nbsp;And, that sometimes can make me so mad at our medical system. &nbsp;For rare disease parents, a diagnosis does not make getting medical care or diagnostics any easier and that can be a difficult pill to swallow when talking with the doctors. &nbsp;I am still angry some days, I cannot change this. I feel overwhelmed and frustrated, but the anger overall has faded and gives way to so many other emotions. &nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Frustration</em>.</strong> &nbsp;Taking care of a special needs child is difficult. &nbsp;Understatement of the century, but it is the simple truth. &nbsp;I hate that I get so frustrated with Steven sometimes, because his actions are not his fault. &nbsp;He is tired. &nbsp;He does not have words yet. &nbsp;Every small action is 100x harder for his little body than for his brother. &nbsp;Most of my frustration is with myself for not having the patience to listen to what he is trying to tell me, but sometimes after days on end of the daily grind, I just do not have anything more to give and I get short-tempered with my children. &nbsp;I am human after all, but in their eyes I am Mom and Mom is so much more than one person—Mom is the maker of food, the daily housecleaner, she puts clean sheets on the bed and clothes in the drawers, she is the healer of all injuries and insults, the ultimate entertainer and friend, mom is a teacher and the fighter of monsters and the banisher of all fears. &nbsp;She is the person in our house that makes the world continue to spin. &nbsp;I am frustrated for still being in survival mode. Honestly, I do not yet see how to get out of survival mode, and as long as the day ends and the next begins I am okay with just surviving. &nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Relief</em>. </strong> On a single piece of paper I have an answer to one of my deepest fears for my child, a diagnosis—“Gene: SYNGAP1; Disease: SYNGAP1-related disorder; Mode of Inheritance: autosomal dominant; Variant: c535delG p.E179SfsX9; Zygosity: &nbsp;heterozygous; Inherited from: unknown; &nbsp;Classification: &nbsp;pathologic variant.” &nbsp;His mutation to the best of our knowledge is a <em>de novo</em> mutation meaning a random single missing G nucleotide in his SYNGAP gene that occurred at conception. &nbsp;This is not my fault. &nbsp;I could not have caused this. &nbsp;I am relieved to know why Steven has so many challenges. &nbsp;I am relieved to know why he is so unique. &nbsp;His extra special needs and Syngapian powers come from a single change in one of his SYNGAP genes. &nbsp;A change that cannot be explained beyond randomness. &nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Helplessness</em>.</strong> &nbsp;Unfortunately, that randomness that makes Steven so very special also makes me feel so very helpless. &nbsp;No matter how much I wish I could, I cannot change the very material that makes up his being. &nbsp;His DNA is as unique to him as any child’s personality or dreams. &nbsp;When Steven struggles at night to sleep or it takes every ounce of strength and focus to grab a toy, I feel helpless. &nbsp;When he falls flat and lays on the floor, I feel helpless. &nbsp;When he is crying and I cannot stop the tears, I feel helpless. &nbsp;And, as he gets older I will continue to feel helpless, because I cannot change how hard life is going to be for him. &nbsp;All I can do is try my best to make each day have as many happy moments as I can for him and his brother. &nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Fear</em>. </strong>Steven is 18 months old and since he was born I have lived in fear of what each day will look like for him. &nbsp;He has so many struggles and some days the sheer quantity of his medical conditions feel overwhelming. The night of his diagnosis I did a google search on his mutation and my fears escalated. &nbsp;I didn’t know I could be more afraid of my son’s future than the unknown. &nbsp;</p><ul><li>Seizures</li><li>Pervasive developmental delays</li><li>Gait abnormalities and orthopedic problems</li><li>Generalized hypotonia</li><li>Autism-spectrum disorder</li><li>Sensory processing disorder</li><li>Sleep problems</li><li>Failure to thrive, these scare the hell out of me. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>But…Steven has been living with most of these problems already and he is still growing, he is still smiling, he still finds joy in each day. &nbsp;Ultimately, the daily problem list did not grow after his diagnosis. Steven does not seem to be afraid of any of these things. &nbsp;He simply needs love, nourishment, encouragement and some fun to make his day as bright as it can be. &nbsp;As his mom, I hold these fears close to my chest and put one foot in front of the other. And, if Steven needs more help, I will find it for him. &nbsp;If he starts having seizures, we will tackle that when we can. &nbsp;Having a diagnosis now means I can do my best to prepare Steven for handling the challenges ahead of him. &nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"104482531_10223404495330763_2614727167285902447_o.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb56954af8b50e424bd98a8_104482531_10223404495330763_2614727167285902447_o.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p><strong><em>Guilt</em></strong>. &nbsp;Before Steven’s diagnosis I felt guilt for not knowing how to help Steven and now with a diagnosis I still feel guilty sometimes for not knowing how to help him. &nbsp;Somehow knowing Steven has a genetic disorder does not take away this guilt, but I can at least put it in perspective. &nbsp;I feel guilty for not giving Tyler enough attention or for not knowing how to meet his needs. &nbsp;I feel guilty for wanting to get away from my kids sometimes and to just be alone. &nbsp;I feel guilty when I just walk away from the dishes or the laundry or the whining kiddos and step outside for a breath. &nbsp;I feel guilty for looking forward to a glass of wine or sharing a beer with my husband (well that was before baby Brown 3 was coming). &nbsp;This is mom guilt. &nbsp;And mom guilt is there no matter if my child has a genetic disorder or not. &nbsp;I cannot always give myself grace, but with time my guilt like my anger is fading. &nbsp; </p><p><strong><em>Grief</em>. </strong> Every single day, sometimes openly and sometimes silently, I grieve for my son, my family, our future. &nbsp;Before Steven’s diagnosis I could pretend that someday he was going to “catch up” to his brother, but now I know Steven will always be different. &nbsp;Life will always be harder for Steven. &nbsp; After talking with other parents, I think we all grieve for what we think we have lost. &nbsp;We all acutely feel the sadness and heartache when our child struggles. &nbsp;Getting a diagnosis only made the stab of sadness so much stronger, because I can never take away his pain or his difficulties. &nbsp;As time passes and Steven ages I grieve, because there is no therapy yet to “fix” his genetic mutation or to boost his SynGap proteins. &nbsp;Steven will always struggle to learn. &nbsp;He will be forced to work harder to every small step he takes, every small or large purposeful movement of his body will take so much more energy than his brother, and I cannot change this. &nbsp;These feelings of sadness are extraordinarily strong, and I know will deepen with time. &nbsp;Sometimes I am overwhelmed by my sadness for my son and family, but like two sides of a coin, Steven shows me joy. &nbsp;He finds happiness in each day. &nbsp;His smile glows and lights up a room. &nbsp;Another mother once asked me when I was pregnant with my first son if I could choose one thing for my baby what would it be? I said I want him to be happy and healthy. &nbsp;She said I could only choose one. &nbsp;If I can keep Steven smiling, I know I can keep going every day, I can keep fighting for him. &nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Acceptance</em>.</strong> &nbsp;This stage I am only beginning to enter. &nbsp;My brain understands I cannot “fix” Steven, I must accept him and all his uniqueness and genetic diversity, but my heart is slower to catch up. &nbsp;My heart still aches for my baby, but that ache is okay. &nbsp;I accept I will be sad. &nbsp;I accept sometimes I will be frustrated or angry. &nbsp;I accept that I am helpless to change his genetic code. &nbsp;I accept that I will fear for his future and feel guilt for not being as strong as I can every second of every day. &nbsp;And I accept that I can focus my emotions and I am helping my son. &nbsp;I am his greatest advocate. &nbsp;I am his daily care-giver and his daily hero. &nbsp;I accept that I have one answer, but not all the answers, and I accept the challenge to fight for my son and my family’s quality of life. &nbsp;Someday we will be more than surviving, I know this in my bones. &nbsp;We have a diagnosis and although I do not know exactly what our future holds at least I have a vague roadmap to follow. &nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Empowerment</em>.</strong> &nbsp;Before Steven’s diagnosis we were treading water and hoping for a ship to come rescue us. &nbsp;Now with a diagnosis, we are the ship. &nbsp;SYNGAP1 mutation means Steven has a disability that will affect him his entire life. &nbsp;He needs therapy and medical professionals to aid in his development and monitor his health. &nbsp;I have a diagnosis to focus my learning such that I can help educate his medical team and I can build a team around him to help him for a long time. &nbsp;Doctors, therapists, insurance companies cannot deny Steven’s special needs. &nbsp;And, I have a diagnosis so we can connect with other families with children affected by a SYNGAP1 genetic mutation. &nbsp;We can build our tribe now and as a tribe we can lean on each other, support each other, and work together to change the world for our children. </p><p><strong><em>Purpose</em>.</strong> &nbsp;I firmly believe Steven is my ambassador of hope and he is meant to change the world. &nbsp;He has a genetic disorder, but he is also my perfect squishy baby. &nbsp;He keeps me grounded, while also encouraging me to push the limits of science and biology. &nbsp;Before Steven I was a veterinarian and a mom. &nbsp;Before Steven’s diagnosis, I was struggling to balance Steven’s needs with Tyler’s needs. &nbsp;Steven’s diagnosis means Steven gives me another purpose—to tell our story, to inform parents and empower them to seek genetic testing, to educate the world on SYNGAP1-related syndrome, to push researchers and biopharma to explore the possibilities of therapies for our children and other children with rare genetic disorders. &nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"105978993_10223433428214067_3385223027355323409_o.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb56954c213231ff40cd1db_105978993_10223433428214067_3385223027355323409_o.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>“God does not make mistakes.” I cannot tell you where I first heard this phrase, but it resonates with me every day. &nbsp;Chris was raised in the Catholic church, I was not. I was not raised to go to church, and I have never read the bible, but this phrase has helped me hold myself together when I feel like I am drowning in my emotions. &nbsp;It holds me together on the days when I feel like I am spinning my wheels trying to coordinate Steven’s doctor appointments. &nbsp;It gives me patience when I cannot comfort him on the days he cries inconsolably. &nbsp;And it gives me grace when I feel guilty for all my feelings of ineptitude, helplessness, and smallness in the world of raising a Syngapian and growing family. These emotions do not happen independently of each other and sometimes it is just a continuum of feelings. &nbsp;Having a diagnosis means I can channel my feelings, but I cannot change them and that is okay. &nbsp;“God does not make mistakes” and Steven is still my perfect squishy baby, so every day as Grandpa Brown would say “we just keep on pedaling.”</p><h2><strong>FINDING OUR TRIBE</strong></h2><p>There are <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/2q20\">over 600 diagnosed</a> children and adults with SynGap globally. &nbsp;Steven was #536 (at least that is what we estimate him to be). That means there are over a thousand parents of diagnosed Syngapians out there. &nbsp;Taking care of a child with special needs is exhausting and isolating and having a diagnosis allowed us to connect to families with children affected by the same clinical syndrome. &nbsp;We have found a tribe with the SynGap Research Fund (SRF). &nbsp;Within the first week of Steven’s diagnosis parents from <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/family-empowerment\" target=\"_blank\">SRF reached out to us and welcomed us</a>. &nbsp;They <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/newdx\" target=\"_blank\">encouraged us to take time to process the information of what his diagnosis means</a> (and we did, kind of) and to ask questions. &nbsp;We asked a lot of questions and quickly realized this was our tribe. &nbsp;These are our people. &nbsp;We are bound by our children and their genetic mutation but we all also share the common goal of trying to better our children’s lives. </p><p>SRF is one support group we found after Steven was diagnosed. &nbsp;For newly diagnosed parents, I strongly encourage you to reach out to each group and meet as many parents as possible to build your tribe. &nbsp;Find the only people who truly understand what you go through each and every day. &nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"104980550_10223394153752230_4303601480386578279_o.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb56954aee5df2e08a4ec2a_104980550_10223394153752230_4303601480386578279_o.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>SRF is based on three principles: &nbsp;collaboration, transparency and urgency. &nbsp;These three principles resonate deeply with Syngapian families. &nbsp;Collaboration means bringing together families, bringing together researchers, and bringing together biopharma companies. &nbsp;Transparency means there are no distortions, no hidden agenda, all of SRF’s activities and finances are open to the public. &nbsp;Transparency also means making the science available to parents to better share the knowledge within the community. &nbsp;On the website there are multiple tabs under each heading. &nbsp;One of the tabs that is a great resource is the knowledge center tab. &nbsp;There are links to the latest articles about SynGap and there are links to blogs to help explain, summarize and synthesize what is happening in academia and the private sectors. Urgency. &nbsp;This speaks for itself, but urgency means “<a href=\"https://effieparks.com/podcast/episode-41-syngap-research-fund\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Time is Brain</em></a><em>”</em> for our children and as time passes critical windows for learning close. &nbsp;As the brain goes each day with too little SynGap protein there is no getting that time back, it’s gone. &nbsp;SRF urgently wants to improve the lives of our children. &nbsp;Perks: &nbsp;SRF hosts webinars to bring researchers face to face with parents. &nbsp;SRF hosts a happy hour Zoom call every Wednesday (at 5 Pacific, here’s the link: bit.ly/SRFHH) to connect parents with each other and share our struggles and triumphs. &nbsp;SRF has a Facebook page to stay connected and to connect extended family with the SynGap community. &nbsp;</p><p>Chris and I joined as many Facebook groups for SynGap families as we could in the first few days following Steven’s diagnosis. &nbsp;I also joined a few local Facebook groups and local mom groups on Facebook to start building a tribe. &nbsp;So far, we have only participated in SRF led functions, but we still follow the other groups online. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>BUILDING OUR TEAM</strong></h2><p>Prior to Steven’s diagnosis we had doctors. &nbsp;Each doctor assessed and made recommendations for each system being evaluated. &nbsp;Now we have a diagnosis and we are building a team for Steven. &nbsp;So far Steven has a Pediatric Neurologist, Pediatric Pulmonologist, Pediatric Gastroenterologist, Pediatric Surgeon, Developmental Pediatrician (upcoming appointment), Geneticist, General Pediatrician, Occupational therapist, Physical therapist, Speech therapist (language) and Feeding therapist (speech OT). &nbsp;We are seeking a second opinion from a regional medical center for neurology and pulmonology and trying to consolidate doctors to 3 institutions (right now we are at about 13 different places to get Steven’s care). &nbsp;These are just for Steven’s current medical problems, but we know that Steven will need these doctors and therapists to help him grow and thrive. &nbsp;He will need them to monitor and follow his medical problem list. &nbsp;And, it is our job as parents to coordinate all of it. It is our job to bring to their attention any changes in Steven’s life or development. &nbsp;It is our job to stay on top of the latest research and therapies so we can share this knowledge with his doctors. &nbsp;Building a tribe has helped Chris and I stay up to date and continue our education to further Steven’s care. </p><p>Lastly, we have contacted and updated Steven’s case through the Alta Regional Center. &nbsp;With Steven’s diagnosis, he was deemed by the Alta Regional Center and is eligible for the Medicaid waiver. &nbsp;He is also eligible for early intervention services, but in our county these services are currently on hold. &nbsp;We are still waiting for Steven’s Medicaid waiver to be processed, but his care will be retroactive to June 1 (the beginning of the month he was deemed). &nbsp;Financially, it is impossible to provide the level of care for Steven that we want to give him to help him grow and gain strength. &nbsp;Medicaid should alleviate some of the financial burden. &nbsp;The Alta Regional Center provides other services as well that we will investigate as we build a team for Steven one step at a time. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"106032628_10223390931911686_7434456934799922396_o.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb56954c97daf38a3904009_106032628_10223390931911686_7434456934799922396_o.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2><strong>PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE</strong></h2><p>SYNGAP1 mutation is a genetic disorder that will forever be a part of our son, so <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/planningsurvey\" target=\"_blank\">we need to plan for his forever</a>. &nbsp;This starts now. &nbsp;First, we contacted our family lawyer and amended our plans to include a Special Needs Trust just for Steven. &nbsp;This trust will hold any funds left for Steven and insure that they cannot count against him in the eyes of the state or federal government as it relates to services. &nbsp;We also had to amend our Will to update who we would want to care for our children in the event that Chris and I pass away before they are 18. &nbsp;We had to make sure that the person we choose is willing and able to accept the responsibility and care for three children, one of which has special needs. &nbsp;</p><p>This meeting with the lawyer brought me to tears. &nbsp;How can I plan for the rest of my child’s life when I am trying to just get through each day? &nbsp;How can I know he will be financially stable when we are trying to just collect and pay the medical bills we already have, and it is only June of this year? &nbsp;How and who can we ask to care for our children if we die too soon? &nbsp;This last question will probably keep me awake at night until all my children are adults, because who can possibly give them, give Steven, the care I can give him. &nbsp;But, these are questions that need to be put into writing, because if there were to be a tragedy, we need to make sure all of our children’s needs are met. &nbsp;Logistically, just getting a special needs trust is all we have done so far. </p><p>Second, the future requires money. &nbsp;Research requires money. &nbsp;Awareness requires money. &nbsp;Fundraising is pivotal to driving research and awareness forward and forward we must go to find therapies for our children. &nbsp;Luckily, we are not alone, we have a tribe. &nbsp;SRF is <a href=\"https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/support-srf-epigenetics\" target=\"_blank\">actively fundraising</a> for specific labs to help answer key questions to the cellular regulation of SynGap proteins. &nbsp;SRF funds labs to <a href=\"https://stemcell.keck.usc.edu/usc-stem-cell-scientists-use-brain-organoids-to-study-intellectual-disability-with-support-from-the-syngap-research-fund/\" target=\"_blank\">grow brain organoids</a> of SynGap children to provide another model for research in addition to the SynGap specific mice. &nbsp;These SynGap mice and organoids are used to better understand the complexity of the SYNGAP1-related syndrome. &nbsp;Research will drive knowledge and therapy. &nbsp;The other side of the coin is awareness. &nbsp;Children and adults need to get a diagnosis in order to have a targeted therapy plan. &nbsp;Diagnosis is key to therapy. &nbsp;First, a diagnosis will enable families to take full advantage of therapies and services through their state or local government. &nbsp;Second, a diagnosis will allow families to join this wonderful forward-thinking community to help find targeted SynGap therapy. &nbsp;More cases of SynGap will draw the attention of biopharma companies to expand their small molecule, gene or antisense therapies to SynGap. &nbsp;The overarching goal is to help our children. &nbsp;We will do this fundraising to support research and awareness, to connect families and educate families, to excite and raise the attention of scientists and biopharma. &nbsp;This is our future. &nbsp;</p><p>For the present, Chris and I have learned not to take anything for granted and to try to be thankful for all we have. &nbsp;We have two beautiful sons (and another baby on the way). &nbsp;We have each other. &nbsp;We have a tribe. &nbsp;We have a plan and a roadmap of where we want to go with our family and with the SynGap community. &nbsp;Our day-to-day has not changed very much, but our future certainly has and for that we can feel all the emotions including empowerment, purpose, and thankfulness. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>‍</p>",

He just wanted to have his mommy all to himself; at 18 months old sharing was not a concept he could grasp yet. &nbsp;Tyler did, however, give you his respiratory virus &amp; at a week old you got very ill. &nbsp;You stopped breathing in the middle of the night and spiked a very high fever. &nbsp;That was the first time my heart stopped for you. &nbsp;You opened your eyes and gave me that look. &nbsp;The look of “I know Mom, it’s going to be very hard, but we will be okay” and I cried. &nbsp;I cried because I love you with every fiber of my being and I thought I lost you. &nbsp;I cried, because I was beginning to understand we were at the start of what would be a struggle to give you all you need in life. &nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"sss dad + 2.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb56a5ec6b431eb2501c32a_sss%2Bdad%2B%252B%2B2.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>You recovered from your respiratory infection, but you continued to struggle to nurse. &nbsp;You choked when nursing from my breast; gasped and vomited when you tried to nurse from the bottle. I went to the lactation consultant and she confirmed you were still not transferring milk. &nbsp;The milk would spill out of your mouth every time you tried to swallow. &nbsp;Your dad and I made the decision to let Dr. A, your pediatrician, correct the anterior tongue tie that restricted the movement of your tongue while nursing. &nbsp;Your latch immediately improved; but, overtime we would realize your transfer and swallow was not improving despite our weekly visits to the lactation consultant over the next several months.</p><p>Every couple months you would continue to get ill with respiratory infections. &nbsp;You would get a high fever and a cough. &nbsp;You required antibiotics and weeks of breathing treatments to improve. &nbsp;You would cry for hours on end everyday and I did not know how to comfort you. &nbsp;I struggled to help you, I struggled to understand what you needed, but I always fought for you, I love you. &nbsp;I would not take no for an answer when pediatricians would tell me it was your personality that made you cry all the time, or it was just reflux making you vomit after every nursing session, or my milk flow was too fast and that was why the milk continued to spill out of your mouth. &nbsp;Despite doctors not listening to my concerns, I sought specialists to help us—but nobody was listening to the entire story, no one physician was looking at the big picture. &nbsp;Together, you and I figured out a way for you to nurse and get enough milk. &nbsp;I spent hours and hours feeding you so you could grow, gain weight and strength. But, you did not thrive. &nbsp;You did not get strong and move or play or use your body. &nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"sss big yellow jacket.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb56a5e7a3d56978093e803_sss%2Bbig%2Byellow%2Bjacket.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>At four months old you were a rolling Rockstar. &nbsp;You rolled right off our master bed, hit your head and went unconscious. &nbsp;That was the second time my heart stopped for you. We immediately took you to the local emergency room and demanded a CT before you were released. &nbsp;Deep down your dad and I knew you rolling off the bed probably did not have long last effects, but we also knew you were struggling to physically develop and thrive. &nbsp;You were being held back and I did not know what was holding you back, but your dad and I knew we would find out and we would help you overcome it.</p><p>You never reached for and grabbed objects. &nbsp;You never reached for me. &nbsp;You would simply give me that look. &nbsp;That look that told me “I need you, I am trying to tell you I am different, I know this is going to be hard, but we will be okay”. &nbsp;Your smile and laugh continues to light up a room. &nbsp;Your laugh comes from deep within your being and it warms our hearts. &nbsp;Your smile and your look propel us to keep seeking answers. &nbsp;Our hope was centered around your laugh, your smile, your inner sunshine. &nbsp;</p><p>At six months old you would not eat solids. &nbsp;Your hands were still clenched in fists as if you physically could not open them. No matter how much you would have wanted to reach, you simply could not. &nbsp;You were still growing. &nbsp;You were at 99% in height and weight, still on tract with your growth chart, but you were weak. &nbsp;Your muscle tone was so low you could not support yourself. &nbsp;You still had episodes at night where you would stop breathing. &nbsp;Your dad and I methodically never forgot to put your breathing monitor on your foot every night. &nbsp;Your night time waking became increasingly more frequent as you got older as if sleeping was uncomfortable or a struggle for you. &nbsp;You would fluctuate between diarrhea and long periods of severe constipation. &nbsp;It appeared that all your muscles were affected. &nbsp;The pediatric gastroenterologist would not listen to my concerns. &nbsp;The pediatrician’s office would not listen to my concerns. &nbsp;At your 6 month wellness visit we were told to try harder. &nbsp;Try harder to make you take a bottle. &nbsp;Try harder to introduce the sippy cup. &nbsp;Try harder to make you open your hands. &nbsp;Try harder to stop nursing at night. &nbsp;Try harder…trying was all we did, you and I would try our best at everything. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"sss therapy.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb56a5ff4ed2b022a0377a2_sss%2Btherapy.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>By 9 months of age I knew you were different, special, it was more than just your personality or my over protectiveness as a mother. &nbsp;After being told it was my fault you were no longer developing like your brother did, that it was my fault you could not open your hands or swallow food or milk, that it was my fault you could not hold yourself to sit or did not have the strength to try to crawl, that it was me delaying your physical development, I knew it was ME that would be the one person to find the answer and get help for you. &nbsp; I asked for a repeat 9 month wellness visit after you injured yourself two times without showing any withdrawal reflex. &nbsp;It was as if you did not feel the mechanical or thermal pain inflicted on your skin until you were badly injured. &nbsp;Dr. A had not seen you in several months and I came prepared. &nbsp;I demonstrated to Dr. A your delays in development. &nbsp;You gave him the look. &nbsp;The look that said “please help me, I am trapped and cannot grow, I cannot spread my wings, I cannot open my hands”. &nbsp;We were immediately referred to a pediatric neurologist in Sacramento.</p><p>On Christmas eve, the pediatric neurologist, Dr. B, confirmed a mother’s greatest fears—you were not normal, you had a severe developmental delay, you display Autism-like behaviors (that was how Dr. B described your intense soul-piercing look), and you could possibly have a brain tumor. &nbsp;We asked about Cerebral Palsy, we asked about trauma caused by rolling off the bed when you were 5 months old, we asked about your repeated apnea episodes and lack of oxygen to the brain, we asked about the jaundice as an infant causing long term neurologic deficits. &nbsp;No answers were given except all those were unlikely. We were told to get an MRI as soon as possible. We listened to the doctor, we did our best to tell your story, and we requested genetic testing. &nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"sss mom eeg cute.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb56a5ff215f268d96e4664_sss%2Bmom%2Beeg%2Bcute.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Two weeks later your dad and I had to hand you over to a pediatric anesthesiologist for an MRI. &nbsp;I have never cried so hard before in my life. &nbsp;My pain came from deep within that only a mother could understand. &nbsp;A pain and fear for my baby and any complications that could come from anesthesia. &nbsp;A pain and fear that would come from the diagnosis of a tumor or long-lasting brain trauma. &nbsp;A pain and fear of not being able to hold you again or feel the warmth and joy of your smile. &nbsp;Your father held me tight and, when the anesthesiologist came to give us an update, we pleaded with her to pull blood and submit it for testing. &nbsp;We wanted your entire genome sequenced. &nbsp;Every strand of your DNA decoded. &nbsp;From my core as a mother I knew that was where you were holding the answer to why you are different. &nbsp;Your dad and the doctor were able to get the blood submitted and then we waited. &nbsp;Preliminary results of the MRI showed your brain is anatomically normal. &nbsp;During recovery from anesthesia, you had a brief EEG to measure your brain waves. &nbsp;It was normal. &nbsp;Your dad and I requested an evaluation by a feeding therapist and recommendation for a pediatric gastroenterologist that would listen to our concerns. &nbsp;During these visits, we discovered you were physically unable to swallow normally and that was probably the reason you would so easily get sick with respiratory infections. &nbsp;You were likely aspirating every time you tried nursing. &nbsp;Nobody listened to your nurse, because you were gaining weight at each wellness check. &nbsp;But, your growth eventually stalled. &nbsp;My body was struggling to keep up with your needs and you could not eat solid foods yet. &nbsp;The doctors recommend a feeding tube. &nbsp;We were supposed to get you a feeding tube a month later, but COVID--a novel respiratory virus--paralyzed the country and your procedure was postponed.</p><p>Over the next four months I built a coat of armor and we started the fight for your life, your quality of life. &nbsp;COVID-19 essentially stopped all services that could help you learn how to use your body. &nbsp;All services that could help you strengthen your muscles. &nbsp;All services that could teach you how to accept and swallow food. &nbsp;I would not give up. &nbsp;My medical background and my care-giving nature would find a way to help you. &nbsp;You slowly opened your hands around 13-14 months old. &nbsp;You gradually made small strides toward a crawl around 15 months old. &nbsp;Everyday was a struggle to help you get nutrition and hydration, but I willed my body to provide for you. &nbsp;Every night was a struggle to help your body relax and sleep, but your father and I never stopped comforting you, rocking you, nursing you. &nbsp;And, then May 12, 2020, at 15 months old, we had an answer. &nbsp;Your diagnosis: &nbsp;<em>SYNGAP1</em> mutation, a heterozygous mutation in the 6th exon of your <em>SYNGAP1</em> gene. &nbsp;This mutation causes your brain cells to only make half the appropriate amount of SynGAP proteins essential for memory, learning, muscle function, behavior, and sleep. &nbsp;It explains all your clinical symptoms. &nbsp;All the developmental delays and difficulties could be explained and your father and I understood you would need specialized assistance. &nbsp;We also learned that your <em>SYNGAP1</em> mutation has a high probability of causing a seizure disorder by the age of 3.

Myoclonic seizures. Atonic seizures. &nbsp;Tonic Clonic Seizures. &nbsp;Epilepsy is one of the more frustrating symptoms of Syngap1, a neurodevelopmental disorder that also causes Intellectual Disability, gross developmental delays, speech deficits, and behavioral challenges, just to name a few. &nbsp;Syngap1 patients run the gamut in the type, duration, and frequency of seizures to which they are susceptible. &nbsp;Seizures are a common conversation topic within our community and collectively we have a wealth of knowledge about how they present and how to handle them in our children.</p><p>I have often counted ourselves as some of the lucky ones with our daughters Epilepsy diagnosis. &nbsp;She was diagnosed with what is seemingly the most benign of all seizure types, Absence Seizures. &nbsp;While still difficult to come to terms with the trauma that is happening within your child’s brain considering the other options in the landscape of Epilepsy we couldn’t really complain. &nbsp;Recently, one of my Syngap mom friends, experienced the worst trauma of a Tonic Clonic seizure in her son who has both an<a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.com/blog/syngap-amp-lgs-one-parents-story-inspired-by-todays-pfdd-meeting\" target=\"_blank\"> LGS and Syngap diagnosis</a>. &nbsp;LGS is a form of epilepsy that predisposes the patient to essentially every seizure type. &nbsp;As I listened to her recount the experience my heart hurt for her and her family. &nbsp;I was thankful for our “benign” seizures thinking that my daughter was still relatively safe from such an event. &nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"autumn swing.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7ab825dffab45a991382d_autumn%2Bswing.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>View fullsize</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately within a matter of weeks my daughter would experience her own Tonic Clonic seizure. &nbsp;I learned immediately that I was not well prepared for such an episode to happen. &nbsp;While I knew <a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/seizure-first-aid-and-safety/adapting-first-aid-plans/first-aid-tonic-clonic-seizures\" target=\"_blank\">the “right” steps to follow in the event of a Tonic Clonic seizure</a>, when faced with the actual situation with my own child my brain scrambled and I feel like I did many things wrong.</p><p><strong>1. Assess the situation quickly and accurately</strong></p><p>I did not immediately recognize that my daughter was having a seizure. &nbsp;She had been having issues with the mucous in her chest and when I heard her gurgling and saw her in her bed with her head back and eyes rolling back I thought she was choking. &nbsp;Since I was not expecting her to have a Tonic Clonic seizure I was not prepared to process what I was seeing. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Lay the person on their side to keep their airway clear. &nbsp;Do not try to hold down or stop the movements.</strong></p><p>For some reason my instinct told me to pick my daughter up. &nbsp;I am not sure why I did this, but I also have come to know that I am not the only parent to have had this reaction. &nbsp;But it was in the moment that I held her that I fully comprehended what was happening and that she in fact was having a seizure. &nbsp;I immediately called for help as my brain started to work in overdrive. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Move away any objects from the person and provide a cushion for their head to protect them from head injury.</strong></p><p>When I put my daughter down I laid her back in her bed. &nbsp;In hindsight I wonder if the floor would have been the better option. &nbsp;I guess as long as somebody was next to her and she could not fall off the bed it is not the worst place to be, but the floor probably would have been a more reliable choice. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Start timing. &nbsp;If the seizure lasts for more than five minutes or it is the person's first seizure call an ambulance.</strong></p><p>I was in full panic. &nbsp;As soon as another person was in the room with me I fumbled, what seemed like endlessly, to get my phone to a screen where I could call an ambulance. &nbsp;I did not time the seizure and could only speculate at its duration. &nbsp;Looking back however my concept of time in that moment was non-existent. &nbsp;I am confident to say that it was under five minutes though. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Do not put anything in their mouth.</strong></p><p>Before I got to the stage of calling the ambulance I noticed my daughters tongue was clamped between her teeth. &nbsp;I tried to get a finger between her teeth, but her jaw wouldn’t budge. &nbsp;I did not try to apply any pressure and as soon as I realized I would not be successful I took my fingers out of her mouth, but nothing should have been put in there to begin with. </p><p><strong>6. Understand that a person’s breathing can become irregular during a seizure and they may even stop breathing for a short period of time. &nbsp;They can become dusky blue around their mouth as a result.</strong></p><p>I never knew that a person stopped breathing during these seizures. &nbsp;I was on the phone with the emergency operator while my daughter lay on her bed limp and exhausted. &nbsp;I walked into her room to give emergency an updated assessment. &nbsp;She shot straight up, looked around bewildered and confused, and took the deepest gasp in. &nbsp;The gravity of what that breath meant hit hard as I lost any calm that may have remained.</p><p>At the emergency room my daughter tested positive for Flu, which is maddening because she was recently &nbsp;vaccinated. &nbsp;They ran her through a CT Scan to check for any bleeds in her brain or lesions, since she had never had a Tonic Clonic seizure before. &nbsp;I thank my lucky stars that all came back okay. &nbsp;They told us that we would want to contact her Neurologist for a repeat EEG as her brain wave pattern may have changed. &nbsp;We already had this on the books, but I did email her Neuro right away to let her know what had transpired. &nbsp;</p><p>I learned that none of our Syngap kids are ever really insulated from these types of events. &nbsp;What I was told by the ER doc is that you expect Fever seizures to be relatively non-existent after the age of five. &nbsp;However this does not hold true in patients that already have an Epilepsy diagnosis, regardless of which type of seizures are typical for them. &nbsp;Due to this knowledge any time my daughter has a fever I will always be hyper aware of the possibilities. &nbsp;Also, her Pediatrician told me that seizures are a symptom of Flu, something I had never heard previously and believe all people should be aware of. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>I do not know that you can ever fully prepare yourself to see your child in such a compromised state. &nbsp;I do not know, knowing what I do now, if I would have reacted any differently in my first experience of my child’s Tonic Clonic seizure. &nbsp;I hope that in the event we are ever in this situation again I will have learned from the experience, that I will recognize more readily what I am seeing and act appropriately. &nbsp;</p><p>Education and awareness is a powerful tool. &nbsp;Learn more about Syngap and Epilepsy by visiting <a href=\"http://www.syngapresearchfund.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.SyngapResearchFund.com</a> and <a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/seizure-first-aid-and-safety/first-aid-seizures-stay-safe-side\" target=\"_blank\">www.Epilepsy.com</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>‍</p>",

I see unlimited potential and a whole galaxy of love. When I first met this boy he looked up at me from my chest with his deep blue eyes, and it was as though I could see his words 'I love you, and, right here, I feel safe..' Now even today, three years later, my Caspian does not speak, but he still communicates so clearly through his eyes.</p><p>Caspian's challenges started to become clear around six months of age when he could not and would not try to eat solid foods. When he was eight months old, I mentioned to our child health nurse the struggle of introducing foods to Caspian. She shrugged this off, and I was told to keep trying different foods and to let him eat off my plate. </p><p>By the time he was twelve months old, I was feeling desperate for help and asked my husband to follow me to our next check-up with the child health nurse. We walked in with a list of developmental milestones Caspian was struggling with, at the top of which was still eating. Caspian was breastfeeding exclusively and missing out on all vital nutrients a one year old needs. Our nurse listened to our concerns and referred us to a child health doctor, finally. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"IMG_20200611_191323.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb56c8e91f26302906055d2_IMG_20200611_191323.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>We were so excited to meet the child health doctor, ready for help, hoping our son would begin to eat and be nourished with food. Unfortunately, that did not happen. The doctor asked us to put Caspian on the floor with some toys, and she watched him crawl around, play and smile. The doctor looked at us and said, \"Your son is fine and healthy, I understand parenting can be exhausting, perhaps the mother needs some therapy? Someone to talk to?”</p><p>I walked out crying, feeling helpless, and as though I was doing everything wrong as a mother; however, my husband believed in me. As an Australian living in Sweden with poor Swedish skills at the time, I feared that I would continue to be ignored, but my husband made sure that didn't happen and wrote a letter to the doctor demanding more help.</p><p>The doctor responded to our letter of concern and sent our son to another child specialist. </p><p>From then on, Caspian had weekly visits with speech therapy and physiotherapy. And, after a few months with the habilitation team, Caspian was diagnosed with Autism. At 18 months of age Caspian started eating for the first time and by 2.5 years of age he was eating enough to stop breastfeeding safely. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"IMG_20200316_154259.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb56c8faa72561381e4f188_IMG_20200316_154259.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Very soon after Caspian's autism diagnosis, we were accepted into the Swedish IBT program (the equivalent of ABA). &nbsp;Caspian has truly thrived in this program and has developed amazing skills in communication, imitation and new motor skills. The team we have here in Sweden have been a huge part of Caspian's success in all his milestones! </p><p>Sadly, we had a little turn back in October 2019, when what we thought was autistic stimming behavior turned out to be epileptic seizures. We had noticed Caspian’s eye rolling months before and asked the doctors about it, but they had dismissed it as stimming behavior. It wasn't until he had his first drop seizure that we took action. Our hearts sank with worry as Caspian was rushed in for testing and diagnosed with epilepsy.</p><p>Caspian started medication right away; however, the first medication did not help at all. Soon Caspian was having clusters of drop seizures, hundreds per day, so we were told to go to the emergency room to break the cycle. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"IMG_20200619_060339.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb56c8fe52c8283f2cd0fbe_IMG_20200619_060339.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>One medication was introduced, and another... The third reduced seizures, but not completely, so Caspian was sent in for more testes. They took CT scans, did a spinal tap, recorded an EEG and — luckily — ordered genetic testing. All the first tests came back normal, and we had to wait a few months for the genetic testing results.</p><p>In May 2020, our beautiful son received a new diagnosis: Syngap1 syndrome. Even though this was a huge surprise for us, this new diagnosis gave us answers to why Caspian has such difficult epilepsy, autism and developmental delays.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"IMG_20200527_093124.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb56c8f5d124994c72b0008_IMG_20200527_093124.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Caspian is a very happy and playful little boy. He laughs and loves cuddles from those who are close to him. Water has always been his favorite! Right now, water is his relaxation: when he has seizures, a bath relaxes him and his seizures seem to pause, briefly. He also loves the trampoline and he has just recently learnt to jump by himself with the help from his big sister, who is usually teaching him fun skills! Another passion of his is dancing and music — Caspian’s laugh and smile can melt anyone's heart when he dances with you.</p><p>Please enjoy this video we made about Caspian. &nbsp;Also, we are currently raising funds for research that will benefit Caspian and all patients with SynGAP, <a href=\"https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/cycle4caspian\" target=\"_blank\">you can support it here</a>.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RUI1cmMEuxQ?wmode=opaque&enablejsapi=1\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div></figure><p><br></p><p>‍</p>",

    "Post Body": "<p>As a nurse, I come across seriously ill people, many of whom rely on the help of a G-tube to get the nutrition they need. Eating for these people is impossible, so through a short procedure called a gastrostomy, a surgeon places a little tube, inserted through the abdomen and held in place with a little balloon filled with water, just inside the stomach. Thinking about a gastrostomy for my little 4-year-old son seemed crazy. I worried about many things - what if Caspian’s autism means he can't stand the tube in his belly? What if he can't sleep at night? As most SynGAP parents know, sleep is a delicate issue. What if he starts eating normally again or will he have to have this all his life? I was overwhelmed with the many running through my head. </p><p>Nevertheless, I write this blog post after a week-long stay in the hospital during which our little Caspian received a G-tube in his abdomen, wanting to share our arduous journey with you.</p><h3>FROM THE BEGINNING </h3><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"caspian5.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb54a33012d59773ac006c9_caspian5.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Caspian has had feeding difficulties since he was 6 months old. &nbsp;At 6 months Caspian’s eating troubles began, even though I did not have any problems breastfeeding him. Transitioning to solid foods became a challenge that we never expected. Hoping it was just part of the learning curve, by 12 months we realized something was not right. Concerned, we asked our doctors for their recommendations and any help that they could give us. Not being able to nourish my child in the way that he needed made me feel like I was failing as a parent.</p><p>Once we were finally accepted into the assisted medical system we received wonderful help from a speech therapist. By 18 months, Caspian started nibbling on select foods—yogurt, baby food, broccoli, mostly pureed foods — a welcome victory. &nbsp;Our momentum continued and by 2.5 years old, Caspian started eating well. I was able to safely stop breastfeeding. It was also around this time our son was diagnosed with autism which contributed to the clarity of why he was experiencing challenges with food.</p><p>Caspian ate well for a few good months! However, after that wonderful period, we noticed Caspian started to be more specific and picky with food. He would find a favorite food, like sausage, toast or a blended nut/date/cacao treat, and only eat those for a week or a month. We accepted this as he maintained his weight and had plenty of energy.</p><h3>A COUPLE OF SETBACKS</h3><p>Caspian’s epilepsy diagnosis at age 3 posed a turning point in his eating habits. It took months to find the right epilepsy medication, and while experimenting with meds, Caspian’s appetite disappeared. For many days he would only eat a sausage, or on bad days he would not eat at all. As a result, his health slowly declined, motor skills regressed and Caspian struggled to reach his milestones. His energy got so low that we had to pause ABA training as he only had enough strength to watch his favorite shows. This is when I started to worry that Caspian might need a G-tube, and decided to exhaust every possibility first. </p><p>The next big setback for Caspian was a month before his G-tube operation. In an attempt to control his seizures we put him on the medication <a href=\"https://www.drugs.com/mtm/lamotrigine.html\" target=\"_blank\">Lamotrigine</a>. Once we started this medication, Caspian completely stopped eating. He also experienced side effects like increased nausea and exhaustion. During this time he was admitted to the hospital for dehydration and stayed overnight receiving fluids. This was our first overnight hospital stay. &nbsp;It was also when I started to view a G-tube more as a welcome option than a dreaded outcome. We took him off Lamotrigine, but Caspian did not recover fully; he continued to eat and drink poorly.</p><p>We had a meeting with epilepsy specialists in Göteborg to try and figure out our next steps. We spoke about trying the <a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/treating-seizures-and-epilepsy/dietary-therapies/ketogenic-diet\">ketogenic diet</a> for seizure control. We noticed that when Caspian stopped eating his body naturally went into ketosis and his seizures were reduced. We decided Caspian was too weak to tolerate any changes to his medical regime, so we postponed the Keto decision. We also discussed his selective eating and how much we struggle with food. These factors led the specialists to suggest a G-tube. After I had tried everything else to help my son, we decided that it was in his best interest. Our doctor sent off the referral, and in two months Caspian was to have his operation. </p><p>Caspian continued to struggle. He didn't want to eat, was lethargic, and did not go to school. We were lost and anxious for him to have the surgery . Our level of concern rose and we called our doctor for emergency advice. They instructed us to go to the emergency room.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"caspian1.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb54a334f544a30ddc8b4ba_caspian1.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Caspian was admitted to the hospital and given an IV to rehydrate him. Our team of doctors decided that we should give him a temporary nasal gastric tube until his G-tube operation. Despite receiving a &nbsp;medication to relax him, our usually quiet little Caspian screamed and choked in pain, as he fought the NG-tube. Unable to give him the necessary nutrients, our doctors expressed the need for an emergency gastrostomy. </p><p>We feared this would be the case. Our thoughts and feelings were all over the place. &nbsp;On the one hand, Caspian wasn’t dramatically underweight and would on occasion want to eat. However, the struggle with food had been going on for three years at that point and this operation felt like a finish line. I will never forget how exhausted and weak Caspian was as I held him in my arms. How could we humor any other option when this was our reality? I talked and cried about my fears to one of the wonderful nurses the night before the operation. She completely understood and said, <em>“Chloe you have been struggling with food for over three years, Caspian needs this tube to give you peace of mind and so he doesn't get so weak every time he stops eating. He can have the tube for a short time or a long time, you really are doing what's best for your son</em>.”</p><p>Our son is non-verbal—he can not speak for himself—so it is always a guessing game. I must be his voice; must see and feel when he doesn't feel good. Doctors can not ask him <em>“where does it hurt?”</em> It is always, <em>“Mum, where does your son hurt?” </em>and while I am in tune with my son's signs, sometimes I worry that I am guessing and perhaps I am not making the right decisions for him. It is so hard, even right now when everything is good again I still wonder if what I am doing is enough or too much? After fasting overnight, Caspian went in for his operation. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"IMG_20201009_173308.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb54a33ea97c158bee1ca63_IMG_20201009_173308.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3>LIFE POST-OPERATION</h3><p>The operation took an hour, a few hours later our little man was awake and responsive. The day after his operation he was allowed to start feeding slowly through the tube. We started with some electrolytes first and then every few hours gave him 50 to 60 ml of formula. Thankfully he managed to keep this down and we slowly increased to 200 ml per meal, or about 200 calories.</p><p>We were in the hospital for another four days, during which Caspian had most of his meals through the tube. The doctors and care team were able to closely monitor his feedings and ensure a successful recovery. We were very fortunate to have received wonderful care! &nbsp;</p><p>By the end of the week we were able to go home and Caspian regained energy fast! We hadn't seen him so energetic since before his epilepsy diagnosis. &nbsp;To our surprise, five days after his operation he spontaneously started eating... Lots! &nbsp;This initially gave me mixed emotions as I wondered if we had made the right decision. I now realize this was indeed the right decision as we now have a backup plan if Caspian ever decides to stop eating again. We can ensure that he will get the necessary nutrients and prevent him from becoming lethargic or dehydrated. Caspian is now able to start a ketogenic diet since we can bypass any problems by feeding him directly with the tube. &nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"caspian2.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb54a33e73612d3d7e109a8_caspian2.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Fortunately, Caspian hasn't had much pain. Like many SynGAPians he does not express pain neurotypically, so we have been watching for any indications of discomfort. Just to be sure, he was given regular doses of <a href=\"https://www.drugs.com/paracetamol.html\">Paracetamol</a> (acetaminophen) for the first five days post-op.</p><p>He is now running around like an active four-year-old, regaining strength after many months of not having the energy to do more than simply rest. The G-tube doesn't seem to bother him at all, and feeding him with the tube has been much easier than I imagined. Thankfully, we have not had to feed him via the G-tube for a few days now as he is eating via mouth regularly.</p><p>I am sure we still have plenty to experience and that will be something for future posts. For now, we are enjoying our energetic happy Caspian whom we have not seen for quite some time. I can say I am happy we have the G-tube for emergencies, as it gives us a peace of mind, knowing Caspian will always be able to receive the nutrition he needs.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"processed (1).jpeg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb54a330ca8ee2cff6c8d03_processed%2B%25281%2529.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4a5SrEYLNU8?wmode=opaque&enablejsapi=1\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div></figure><p>Video by Chloe of her family doing Cycle4Caspian 2020, a 420km ride around the Swedish lake Vättern to raise funds towards Syngap1, Epilepsy research!</p><p>‍</p>",

(The first SynGAP1 Encephalopathy diagnosis was <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2925262/\">in 2010 by Dr. Michaud</a>.) &nbsp;Our impressive list of medical specialists keeps growing, and I must verbally account for his detailed and complex medical history at each appointment. &nbsp;None of the doctors we see have heard of SynGAP before I walk into their office. &nbsp;SynGAP treatments are currently being developed, and researchers will need detailed patient data to run successful clinical trials. &nbsp;The need for medical record management and analysis is at an all-time high in our community, to manage medical care for our loved ones, and to test treatments. </p><p><strong>To the rescue: &nbsp;</strong>Ciitizen and Syngap Research Fund are partnering to leverage our existing and ongoing patient medical records into a powerful set of data. &nbsp;Signup for families is quick and easy. &nbsp;SRF created this opportunity by convincing Ciitizen to help our disease community today rather than some day. &nbsp;Ciitizen does all the work to collect and analyze records. &nbsp;This project helps individual families and at the same time contributes to the detailed characterization of our patient population. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ciitizen.com/syngap1/\">ciitizen.com/syngap1</a></p><p><strong>The SynGAP Individual:</strong> The family of each SynGAP patient has unlimited access to all their patient records, online in the Ciitizen portal, in a format that is searchable, shareable, printable, and completely yours, forever. &nbsp;You list the places your patient has had medical care and consent to share the information with Ciitizen, and the Ciitizen team gathers all the medical records, digitizes and analyzes them. It is easy: &nbsp;families are not asked to undergo medical tests or imaging, not required to travel to a centralized doctor or hospital, and are not charged any fees. &nbsp;No fees for signup, no fees for record collection, no fees for looking at your data, no fees for data summaries. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>SynGAP1 Encephalopathy characterization:</strong> &nbsp;Ciitizen analyzes the digitized, de-identified data for all the consenting SynGAP patients within the Ciitizen platform. &nbsp;The group findings are available to families, and shared with SynGAP researchers. &nbsp;Ciitizen employs an amazing team of experts (in HIPPA law and medical coding, genetic counselors, software developers, and PhD scientists). &nbsp;They use &nbsp;world-standard terminologies (like SNOMED codes, RXNORM codes and others). &nbsp;They also identify issues with codes that come up for rare disease patients and push for the adoption of new SNOMED codes that help describe our disease state in increasingly relevant detail. &nbsp;In September they had already requested nearly 200 new codes based on their work in Rare Neurological diseases. &nbsp;The addition of codes will allow certain features of our syndrome to be analyzed instead of lost due to a lack of “vocabulary.”</p><p><strong>The business:</strong> &nbsp;Ciitizen was started with founder and venture funding. &nbsp;Ciitizen is a success for its first community, cancer patients, with mainstream diseases like breast cancer as well as rare cancers like cholangiocarcinoma. &nbsp;They are now expanding to serve the neurological disease population. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ciitizen.com/the-rare-disease-crusaders/\">ciitizen.com/the-rare-disease-crusaders/</a> &nbsp;SynGAP is one of the first rare, neurological diseases to have access to Ciitizen due to the hard work of the SynGAP Research Fund. &nbsp;SRF is paying Ciitizen a fee, a fraction of the actual cost of the work for SynGAP families. &nbsp;Patients pay nothing now or later. &nbsp;Eventually the business model calls for pharmaceutical companies who are interested in the digitized natural history-type data to license the non-identifiable data. &nbsp;Why would they pay for the data?</p><p><strong>High value data:</strong> Natural Histories are essential for clinical trials, but they are prohibitively expensive, very time consuming, and re-test patients for things that they have already been tested for. &nbsp;Ciitizen has created an efficient process to extract information from the medical records we’ve already and continue to collect. </p><p>To test a treatment, we need actual physical measures that show progress over a range of patients with different ages, genetic backgrounds, severities, and medications. &nbsp;This is not simple. &nbsp;The partnership between SRF and Ciitizen is filling this essential step toward therapies and cures for our Syngapians.</p><p><strong>Success:</strong> &nbsp;The first cohort of 50 patients already enrolled and are enjoying having their data in one place. &nbsp;The first read out will be shared at the 2nd Annual Syngap Roundtable and <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/rt2\">we encourage you to attend, there is no cost to register</a>. </p><p>One thing that makes ciitizen so powerful is how little work families have to do &amp; how much they get back. &nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><a href=\"https://ciitizen.com/SYNGAP1\"><div><img alt=\"ciitizen todo.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fe5a854f009755fb0ea6f08_ciitizen%2Btodo.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></a></figure><p><strong>How do I participate?</strong> Gather a photo of your patient’s birth certificate, your driver license, and a list of the locations your patient has received medical care. &nbsp;We expect the next cohort to start enrolling on December 1, 2020. &nbsp;Please go sign up at <a href=\"https://www.ciitizen.com/syngap1/\">ciitizen.com/syngap1</a>. &nbsp;When you click Get Started, you will either join a waitlist or begin enrollment. &nbsp;Use the chat tool if you have questions. &nbsp;Ciitizen will collect and analyze information from another 50 US families over several months. &nbsp;Our community is incredibly lucky to be one of the first rare neurological syndromes addressed by Ciitizen.</p><p><strong>Please join:</strong> <em>This project is the most important and useful thing families can do to accelerate treatments for our SynGAP patients. Signing up and consenting to the use of your records is something that only you, a rare disease family, can do. Please consider if it is right for you.

    "Post Body": "<p><a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/team-profiles/marta\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Dr. Marta Dahiya</em></a><em> is a Radiation Oncologist and a Director of SRF. &nbsp;We are grateful for her tireless work co-leading the Webinar Series, engaging with researchers and pushing SRF forward every day. </em></p><p>As the mom of a 17-year-old Syngapian girl, I have experienced the challenge of heavy and painful periods (dysmenorrhea) since she was 12 years old. I also was worried about starting puberty because changes in hormones can trigger seizures. As a result, I did a consultation with a pediatric gynecologist when my daughter was 14 years old. &nbsp;Besides over the counter medications <a href=\"https://www.medicinenet.com/nonsteroidal_antiinflammatory_drugs/article.htm\" target=\"_blank\">NSAID</a>s (ibuprofen and naproxen), the options were:</p><ul><li>oral contraceptives, </li><li>a hormone patch, or</li><li>a <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/depo-provera/about/pac-20392204\" target=\"_blank\">Depo-Provera</a> shot.</li></ul><p>All of these came with a higher risk of systemic side effects and possible interactions with certain anti-epileptic drugs. I opted for not doing anything as I was afraid of the systemic side effects including changes in behaviors, mood swings, increased seizures, and depression, among others. &nbsp;This was three years ago.</p><p>Since then, however, IUDs have become well accepted and even recommended in teenagers. Currently, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-bulletin/articles/2017/11/long-acting-reversible-contraception-implants-and-intrauterine-devices\" target=\"_blank\">strongly supports IUD use among adolescent females</a>. But how will an IUD impact a Syngapian? </p><p>I read &nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-0016\" target=\"_blank\">Intrauterine Device Use in Adolescents With Disabilities</a> by <a href=\"https://hospitals.jefferson.edu/find-a-doctor/s/schwartz-beth-i.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Beth Schwartz</a>, et al was published in <em>Pediatrics</em> in August 2020. The article references the use of an IUD containing slow-release progestogen, called <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/20268-levonorgestrel-intrauterine-device-iud#:~:text=LEVONORGESTREL%20IUD%20(LEE%20voe%20nor,that%20occurs%20during%20your%20period.\">Levonorgestrel</a>, in disabled teens. </p><p>The results show lower risk of complications. So far these IUDs have not shown statistically significant interaction with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) or an increase in seizures. Considering the limited literature on the topic, I think it is important to share this information with other parents of a female Syngapian who are currently, or will eventually, navigate this issue.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=\"https://www.medpagetoday.com/obgyn/generalobgyn/87717?trw=no\" target=\"_blank\"><em>MedPage Today</em></a> Dr. Schwartz said \"This is a really effective method for young women with disabilities or other medical conditions…I think we are slowly taking down some of the barriers around who can and should use IUDs.\"</p><p>Full disclosure, I work in the medical field, but this is not medical advice. &nbsp;As a parent, I am sharing this information and my experience to make sure you consider an IUD, even if sedation may be necessary to place it. &nbsp;This is a good option when other less invasive and over the counter medications like NSAIDs have failed to provide help with good menstrual hygiene, decrease in the amount of the menstrual periods and control of the pain. Also, slow-release progesterone IUDs appear to be a better option compared to other hormonal contraceptives like Depo-Provera or patch as the systemic side effects are significantly less. </p><p>Unfortunately, the public cannot access this important article without a subscription. &nbsp;The <a href=\"https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/146/2/e20200016\" target=\"_blank\">abstract</a> can be read and includes this video which is less than four minutes. &nbsp;Your physician should have access to the paper and I encourage you to share this blog with them if you are discussing this.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\"><div><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayers.brightcove.net%2Fpages%2Fv1%2Findex.html%3FaccountId%3D6056665225001%26playerId%3DUxkvalZ0%26videoId%3D6158593565001%26mode%3Diframe&display_name=Brightcove&url=http%3A%2F%2Fplayers.brightcove.net%2F6056665225001%2FUxkvalZ0_default%2Findex.html%3FvideoId%3D6158593565001&image=https%3A%2F%2Fcf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net%2Fv1%2Fjit%2F6056665225001%2F587b6e69-4158-41bd-bd38-5563f3281b48%2Fmain%2F1280x720%2F2m24ms%2Fmatch%2Fimage.jpg&key=61d05c9d54e8455ea7a9677c366be814&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=brightcove&wmode=opaque\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div></figure><p>In her review of Schwartz’s article titled <a href=\"https://www.jwatch.org/na52107/2020/08/03/iuds-are-effective-menstrual-management-teens-with\" target=\"_blank\">IUDs Are Effective for Menstrual Management in Teens with Disabilities</a>, <a href=\"https://www.jwatch.org/editors/AU3274?editor=Jenny%2520Radesky,%2520MD\">Dr. Jenny Radesky</a> commented that “Self-care and menstrual health should be discussed early and in developmentally appropriate terms as children with disabilities enter adolescence. Management of pain and heavy bleeding can improve the quality of life for teens with disabilities and the parents who care for them and support the teen's rights to sexual and reproductive health. These results suggest that IUDs should be on the list of initial management options, especially if access to experienced pediatric gynecologists is available and teens have other surgical procedures planned.”</p><p>For more information about this study, see:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.aappublications.org/news/2020/07/24/iuds-adolescents-disabilities-pediatrics\">The Use of IUDs in Adolescents with Disabilities: A Menstrual Management and Contraceptive Option Well Worth Considering </a>by Dr Lewis First Editor in Chief, <em>Pediatrics</em>.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.healio.com/news/primary-care/20200727/iuds-viable-option-for-menstrual-management-in-adolescents-with-disabilities\">IUDs viable option for menstrual management in adolescents with disabilities</a> in <em>Healio</em>.</li></ul><p>For more information regarding this IUD use in epilepsy, see:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27677612/#:~:text=Diary%20data%20showed%20that%20seizure,the%20IUD%20throughout%20the%20study.\">Women with epilepsy initiating a progestin IUD: A prospective pilot study of safety and acceptability</a> in <em>Epilepsia</em>, 2016.</li><li>This <a href=\"https://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/living-epilepsy/women-and-epilepsy/contraception-and-epilepsy#:~:text=Contraceptive%20injections%2C%20such%20as%20Depo,affected%20by%20enzyme%2Dinducing%20AEDs.\">helpful article about Contraception &amp; Epilepsy</a> from the UK Epilepsy Society.</li></ul><p>‍</p>",

However, we recognize that not everyone has the bandwidth or feels the need to dive deep into the world of SYNGAP1.&nbsp; No matter how involved you want or can be, every family has the power to make a big difference with only 15 minutes of their time by joining the <a href=\"https://www.ciitizen.com/syngap1/\" target=\"_blank\">Ciitizen SYNGAP1 Digital Natural History Study</a>.</p><h3><br><strong>If you can only do one thing to help, this should be it.&nbsp; </strong></h3><p>Natural History Studies are critical to accelerate treatment because they help define what is &nbsp;measured in clinical trials.&nbsp; Whether a drug, a precision medicine, or some other treatment is found, it cannot get approved without a clinical trail. &nbsp;For that trail, you need an “endpoint” or something to measure; to find those, you need a Natural History Study.&nbsp; The bigger the patient group in the study, the more powerful the data.&nbsp; And only SynGAP families have the power to join and consent for data analysis.<strong><br><br></strong>A Natural History Study follows a patient group over time and collects data that helps scientists and researchers understand the disease and how it evolves.&nbsp; Traditional prospective longitudinal “forward-looking” Natural History Studies are usually expensive, take years to complete, and require families to answer questions every six months and to physically travel to a clinic to collect data. They are therefore at high risk of &nbsp;“drop-out” where families (often through no fault of their own) are unable to continue with the study. Additionally, families often never again get to see the data that were collected about the patient. </p><p>Ciitizen is different. They make it easy for families to join and keep records updated. Ciitizen securely pulls the entire electronic medical history of patients, using high quality data from existing medical records, clinician notes and imaging, instead of relying only on information provided by caregivers. Ciitizen digitizes and organizes the data, and provides a disease summary easily accessible to families and researchers. </p><p>When you sign up, you will enter all the medical institutions that hold the Syngap patient’s medical records. Ciitizen does the heavy lifting for you and will reach out to each one of them on your behalf. A couple of weeks later you will start seeing the medical records come in the platform.&nbsp; You don’t pay anything for this service.</p><p>It was a great feeling to have all of my child’s records accessible any time in a central place.<br>I found myself reading through many records and finding doctor’s notes I had never seen before. You can search through all of the records as they are nicely organized and share them easily with providers when needed.</p><p>SRF is governed and led by SynGAP parents and our priority will always be SynGAP families. We are all dealing with the daily challenges of taking care of a loved one affected by SynGAP. &nbsp;When we had the opportunity to advance research with limited demand on families (did I mention it only takes 10 minutes) and to provide a tool that can empower them, it was a near perfect solution.</p><p>‍</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ciitizen.com/syngap1/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Join the SYNGAP1 study</em></strong></a><em>.&nbsp; It is something urgently needed that only families with a SynGAP variant can provide.&nbsp; Each family that is added increases the power of the study.&nbsp; And a strong Natural History Study is required for any therapies to go to trial.&nbsp; This is totally free to families as SRF is covering the cost. &nbsp;You will get your own account at ciitizen.com with this study!</em></p><p>‍</p>",

    "Post Body": "<p><em>JR is a SynGAP parent &nbsp;with a PhD in Genetics, she is an active member of the SRF parent Medical-Science team.</em></p><h4><strong>Variant: a DNA sequence that is different from the expected DNA sequence.&nbsp;</strong></h4><h4><strong>Unknown Significance:&nbsp;the effect on the patient is unknown.&nbsp;</strong><br></h4><p>A genetic report describes locations in the patient’s DNA that are different from what is expected.&nbsp; Most of the differences, called variants, are classified as benign&nbsp; (not harmful in effect) or likely benign, pathogenic (causing disease) or likely pathogenic. &nbsp; If you are one of the minority of families faced with a Variant of Unknown Significance, or VUS, it is hard to know what to think or feel.&nbsp; A VUS is truly that -- research scientists, medical doctors, and specialists like geneticists and genetic counselors simply do not have enough information about the gene to know or predict the effects of the genetic variant reported.&nbsp; Keep reading to learn more about how to think about a VUS and what steps a family might take to learn more.<br></p><p>VUS findings in a genetic report occur in many settings, including cancer risk, diseases arising from changes in multiple genes, and single gene disorders.&nbsp; This discussion is aimed only at pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders, where the parents do not display the same features as the patient, and a variant is in only one copy of the two genes we inherit from our two parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>SYNGAP1-related Non-Syndromic Intellectual Disability (NSID) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, with symptoms starting in early childhood.&nbsp; People with a pathogenic variant in the SYNGAP1 gene may have to deal with learning difficulties, epilepsy, Autistic features, sensory processing differences, sleep disturbances, low muscle tone, communication and eating difficulties, and more.&nbsp; People who are affected in this way by a variant in the SYNGAP1 gene are fondly called Syngapians by their families. The “typical” Syngapian doesn’t exist, as our kids can have vastly different levels of seizures and communication, to name just two highly prevalent issues.&nbsp; There <em>is</em> a typical genetic report, however.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A typical genetic report describes the variant in the SYNGAP1 gene as <em>de novo</em> (new). Pathogenic SYNGAP1 variants usually originate at conception, and are not typically found in the patient’s biological parents.&nbsp; A typical genetic report has a finding that one copy of the gene (heterozygous) is broken.&nbsp; SYNGAP1-related Intellectual Disability is considered a haploinsufficiency, meaning that having only one working copy of the gene causes a lowered level of SYNGAP1 function, and the symptoms of the disorder.&nbsp; And a typical genetic report includes a pathogenic (causing disease) or likely pathogenic finding.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants include those that stop the protein before it is complete (protein truncating variants, some splice variants, insertions and deletions), those that delete a copy of the gene (copy number variants and large deletions), and those that partially reduce the amount of functional protein (some splice variants).&nbsp; In these cases, enough is known about how genes operate to be confident in assigning a pathogenic or likely pathogenic classification.&nbsp; If you want a deeper explanation of how to read a genetic report <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/understanding-your-genetic-report-with-syngap1-a-rare-disease\" target=\"_blank\">see this article</a>.<br></p><p>Other types of changes in the DNA sequence have hard-to-gauge effects on gene function.&nbsp; For example, a change in one amino acid might reduce the amount of functional protein, or it might not.&nbsp; Even a change in the gene that does not change an amino acid might have an effect, or it might not.&nbsp; No matter the variant type or its location in the gene, if it is designated a VUS, it means that professionals are not currently sure of the consequence of the variant.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><h4>What kind of information would change the VUS status?<br></h4><p>The status of a VUS can change to either benign or pathogenic with new information.&nbsp; Your genetic counselor has most likely already talked to you about looking at the DNA of the biological parents to search for the same variant.&nbsp; If a parent (without SYNGAP1-related NSID) has the identical variant, the variant is considered benign in the patient.</p><p>Another place to look for new information is in the ever-growing genetic databases of variation in healthy populations.&nbsp; When a variant is in a database describing natural variation, it can be classified as benign.</p><p>If a research lab can study the effects of the variant in question in an animal model system, the human VUS would be predicted to have similar effects.&nbsp; Please note that this is not a current test available, but is the type of basic research needed in order to better understand the range of genetic variants that cause SYNGAP1-related NSID.</p><p>Geneticists and testing companies are getting better at predicting the effects of DNA changes on gene function.&nbsp; Data sets are constantly growing, and Artificial Intelligence tools are improving.&nbsp; As time goes on, we will be better able to predict the effects of VUS findings.</p><p>Many geneticists, including Dr. Heather Mefford of St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, TN and Dr. Gemma Carvill at the Fineberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago, IL, are searching for additional genetic changes that impact diseases like epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders.&nbsp; They are searching in the entire genome, including areas that don’t code for proteins, and their findings will help genetic reports be more conclusive.</p><p>A biomarker is something measurable that correlates with disease, where the severity of disease is reflected in the level of the biomarker.&nbsp; Biomarkers can come in the form of testing bodily fluids (such as blood, saliva, spinal fluid, urine), imaging like MRIs or X-Rays, or measuring movements like brain waves with an EEG or eye movements, or recording behaviors, and more.&nbsp; Currently there are no biomarkers that correlate with SYNGAP1-related NSID, but they are highly sought after.&nbsp; Once biomarkers are identified and clinical tests are available, they will be another source of information to describe a patient’s symptoms.&nbsp; Understanding clinical symptoms is an important part of classifying variants.</p><p>If you have a genetic report with a VUS, every year or two you may want to go back to your geneticist to see if any new information has changed the status of the VUS.&nbsp; Here are three questions you might bring to your genetic counselor or geneticist at follow-up appointments.&nbsp;<br></p><ol><li>Likely this was already covered by your geneticist, but if not, do the biological parents show the same variant?&nbsp; Test both biological parents, or potentially other family members if parents are not available. <em>If yes, the variant is not pathogenic.&nbsp;&nbsp;If no, no new information is known about the VUS.</em></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li>Has the variant been added to any of the various databases describing human variation?&nbsp;<em>If yes, this is not pathogenic.&nbsp;&nbsp;If no, no new information is known about the VUS.</em></li><li>Have any tests been recently developed to get more information from this patient?&nbsp; Are there any biomarkers? Depending on the variant, your geneticist might be interested in ordering clinical tests, including RNAseq data in some cases.</li></ol><p>What can you do today?&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/families/connect-with-us\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up with SRF</a> to get updates on the latest research on biomarkers, genetic variant status, and to get support.&nbsp; Whatever combination of genetic reports and clinical features got you to consider a SYNGAP1-related NSID diagnosis, it is worth support and information.&nbsp; <br></p><p>Over time, Variants of Unknown Significance will be sorted into benign and pathogenic categories.&nbsp; Until then, join any communities you might be part of through a VUS and learn more about what may be ahead, including potential treatments.&nbsp; Welcome!&nbsp; We are all learning as we go.<br></p><p>‍</p><h4>Further reading:&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4><p>Invitae Corporation (a genetic testing company) has an extensive explanation of variant classes, and builds on the current (ACMG, see below) standards.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.invitae.com/en/variant-classification/\">Invitae.com/en/variant-classification</a><br></p><p>Richards S, Aziz N, Bale S, Bick D, Das S, Gastier-Foster J, Grody WW, Hegde M, Lyon E, Spector E, Voelkerding K, Rehm HL, ACMG Laboratory Quality Assurance Committee. 2015.

His seizures were diagnosed at sixteen months and we began what I can only describe as a rollercoaster of trying to manage his severe epilepsy, while still providing him the best quality of life possible. Eating has been one aspect of life where we have seen some really high highs and some really low lows. At his best, Emmitt asks to eat, thoroughly enjoys eating a variety of foods, and gains weight like a champ. At his worst, we’ve had to force feed him and syringe him water for months at a time. On this ride, I’ve noticed several factors that I feel have most affected his feeding and may be of help to others.&nbsp; I’ve decided to share them here. If you’re reading this and are on the other side of the spectrum with a child who overeats regularly, please consider sharing your experience with us through a blog of your own!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Seizures&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You may already be aware that children with SynGAP have a unique trigger for some of their seizures: chewing! In fact, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6340340/\">in this 2019 paper</a>, 25% of the participants had seizures triggered by eating. In the early days of Emmitt’s epilepsy, seizures were solely visible while he was sitting and eating in his high chair (see video https://youtu.be/2FAG67JrmTY) Emmitt got to the point that sometimes touching food or thinking about putting food in his mouth would trigger an eye flutter and even head nods. While seizures during feeding seem to have become his new normal, they certainly are unpleasant for him and prolong the time it takes for him to eat. At his worst, Emmitt would seize with every bite and sometimes hit his head on the table.</p><p><br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fdd19cc44ab3e6e927fa4c9_qXm4BlR5eOgKu0AgSaRQlN5dzwaQvN5ECWGldvr4pD0zbFeHp75lLjF2W3O8onUGUkJRhoZkG_cvxyY6_x3UcXgOBEDetan0EIv_-pynQ_hr4hfvqPuGauQ21NTc9nI0ljzB0Up6.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Sitting in front of Emmitt during a meal so that I can see his face to count seizures.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Seizure Drug Side Effects</strong></p><p>These days we are on five -yes five! - antiepileptic drugs. As one increases the number of medications, the likelihood of unhappy side-effects also increases. I was only truly able to identify effects on Emmitt’s appetite because I kept records of eating and drinking, and insisted on regular blood work. Because we are still titrating new medications, we still go for monthly blood draws to monitor <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/17679-elevated-liver-enzymes\">liver enzyme levels</a> which are famous for getting out of whack due to certain seizure medications (a side effect of elevated liver enzymes is loss of appetite.).&nbsp; In one particularly drawn out season, Emmitt’s liver enzymes were so elevated after adding Epidiolex to Valproic Acid and Clobazam that he refused to eat and drink for three months until we reduced the two latter medications to acceptable levels. The waters can get very murky in the land of multiple medications and your neurologist and a gastroenterologist can help you monitor medication and liver enzyme levels when needed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Oral Mechanics</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6340340/\">The paper mentioned above</a> also found that 30% of participants had chewing and swallowing difficulties. At a year of age, Emmitt subsisted mostly on breast milk and the occasional bit of yogurt or baby puree. This is around the age that babies typically are decreasing their breast milk or formula intake and getting more serious about table foods that the rest of the family eats. We enlisted the help of a speech therapist with expertise in managing feeding challenges and worked at giving Emmitt facial massages and other exercises she gave us as well as encouraging him to put soft foods in his mouth. Over several months, he did improve to eventually be able to eat most foods with the family. However, later speech therapists ended up referring us to have a <a href=\"https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/abr2463#abr2464\">swallow study</a> done to make sure that Emmitt was not <a href=\"https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/a/aspiration-from-dysphagia.html\">silently aspirating</a> on any of his food or water. In some cases, our children with SynGAP do have abnormal findings on these studies which can be in part due to <a href=\"https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions-and-treatments/conditions/m/muscle-weakness-hypotonia\">hypotonia</a>. A team for addressing the oral mechanics of chewing and swallowing is typically comprised of a speech and/or feeding therapist, an occupational therapist, a neurologist, and an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fdd19cc32927c83f5e5ca55_F2nlig74K6GG3raxGeupqwjPBj7dSfTy9oQ6qI8Q7bSs3S7qoON1UR9KRH6N74rxURKnVIumKO6icqMJuST77rRe5FHRcoyn7kaSgNHBKveG8oj4UbA3BICIahU1bfdgVm0-6Xf-.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Oral motor exercises with his first speech therapist.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Constipation, Reflux, and Illness&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Constipation, reflux and illness have each negatively impacted Emmitt’s feeding at one point or another. Unlike my older children who get ill and usually begin eating again within a couple days, illness for Emmitt can mean weeks of poor eating and drinking. Emmitt struggles with constant constipation which means that he can sometimes go days without stooling and get uncomfortably bloated. This back-up contributes to reflux which also makes him reluctant to eat.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Social Considerations</strong></p><p>We flunked out of the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/FqzNIuINXsY\">keto diet</a> after four months. I have several theories about why it wasn’t successful for Emmitt, but they center around social/emotional reasons. For one, Emmitt was enjoying food at the time he started keto, so suddenly having to withhold some of his favorite foods that were too high in carbs, like watermelon, was frustrating for him. Then insisting on him eating lots of fats meant needing to spoon feed him many foods covered in high fat sauces instead of using his hands to feed himself as he was used to doing. Furthermore, we were going through an <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/emmitt\">international move at the time</a>, so I didn’t have the energy to completely revamp the entire family’s diet. This meant he watched his older brothers eat foods he was not allowed to have and was instead given food he didn’t prefer. I can only imagine that other children with SynGAP experience similar frustrations related to the social dynamics of food. This is, of course, exacerbated by the inability to easily communicate these frustrations with caretakers.</p><p><br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fdd19cc06a35838fa18281a_M2KSY01W3C8Z4zxRJrDZfeLx4GF_5C6FI5263Y7-JaPUHvfCy2sVAxKv6_wFkFPxOwgeytYaUUri6ud6A9SZuFR6XMacmfvCyPLjlKQHwDUKTNobKLxLTz8aU2eoQRYzn2FRqx3B.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Trying to power through a keto breakfast with the help of Youtube videos on my phone.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sensory Challenges</strong></p><p>Our kids exhibit sensitivities to all kinds of things in their environments that we, as caretakers, may take for granted. Many parents have vouched for the effectiveness of having a distraction during eating such as a book, or bubbles, or their iPad. When I’ve ruled out all of the above possibilities for poor eating, I’m inclined to think that I need to let Emmitt be my guide because there is so much going on in his brain that I don’t understand. I try to take note of textures, food items, the environment, his sleep the night prior, and even my mood to understand what may be contributing to poor eating. During our three month stint of poor eating earlier this year, our feeding therapist had him touch all kinds of foods and play in them for fun. He was very averse to this. However, once we corrected his seizure medications and his appetite returned, we found he was much more willing to touch foods and didn’t find the sight of them noxious anymore. One parent has mentioned to me that their child repeatedly, frequently swallowed so much excess air that her abdomen became painfully distended and caused loss of appetite. It’s another example of the confounding ways our children can experience the world when their brain is not functioning properly, even when it comes to something as necessary as eating.</p><p><br></p><p>The last six months have been kinder to us as far as eating goes. We don’t skip meals anymore and I don’t wake up in the middle of the night with anxiety about having to feed him. But we are still very much on the rollercoaster. Emmitt has just started a brand new medication, <a href=\"https://www.fintepla.com/\">Fintepla</a>, which was previously used as a weight loss drug. I’m putting our past experience to use trying to mitigate side-effects as we continue to titrate up and pray for better seizure control. We ultimately ended up placing a feeding tube in August of 2020 to help Emmitt by augmenting his water intake and to give us peace of mind for the challenges we know we will continue to face regarding eating. It was a tough decision but one that has benefited all of us significantly. While I ultimately hope Emmitt will not always need it, it is comforting to know we can prevent him from facing dehydration and malnutrition when feeding challenges pop up in the future.</p><p><br></p>",

    "Post Body": "<p><em>Caroline is a Syngap mom to 8 year old Yonas and also helps manage the SRF Blog. She is excited to have the chance to contribute to the SRF Long-Term Planning Series (while educating herself about this important topic!).</em></p><p>While I consider myself a fairly resourceful individual for whom “googling” information about pretty much anything is second nature, I have somehow struggled to wrap my head around the importance and the rationale of setting up an ABLE account for my 8-year-old son, Yonas. I should mention that we live in NY state - an incredibly giving part of the country - we are so lucky. Yonas qualifies for all kinds of government programs including the Medicaid Waiver program, Self-Direction (which includes 45 hours of respite services per week) and private schooling paid by our school district. Lastly, we are also fortunate enough to have jobs that afford our family private health insurance which covers all of Yonas’ medical appointments and private ABA therapy for after school.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The reason Yonas’ benefits and access to support is important to mention here is because it is the very reason I have struggled to understand why an ABLE account would even be necessary for him. For quite some time, we were asking ourselves: “Why do we need to set up an ABLE account and allocate funds towards it when Yonas is enrolled and eligible for all kinds of public and governmental programs that will take care of him throughout his life?”<br></p><p>Luckily, I had the chance to connect with Summer, another Syngap parent, and she was able to shed light on the need for an ABLE account a bit more. She explained that she envisions her son, Ryker, using the ABLE funds to pay for things like clothes, groceries, hobbies, health and wellness, transportation and anything else that will optimize his happiness and everyday living.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Riiiiiiight, the everyday stuff, I realized. What an “aha” moment that was for me. My husband and I hadn’t even thought of that. We are always so busy thinking “big picture” that we were unintentionally avoiding more concrete thinking about our son’s future. It’s also just so hard to think about long-term planning when the immediate needs are so overwhelming and intense at times. Summer has a great analogy that helps explain what the ABLE funds are. She says, the ABLE account is almost like the child’s debit card (when (s)he is old enough to use it) especially for things that will not be covered by the waiver programs or any other government-level or public support.<br></p><p>Since Yonas will most likely live under our close watch when he is an adult (maybe even with us in our home), we will always need to provide him with some sort of “allowance” or at least have some cash put aside that will be used to invest in his basic and everyday living needs. I also realized through my conversation with Summer that unlike my other kids, Yonas’ developmental trajectory will (most likely) not include a transition to getting a job toward the end of being financially independent someday - seems obvious, but again, just not something we had consciously taken the time to think about.<br></p><p>So in conclusion, why not begin saving up money in a 529 ABLE Savings account while growing those assets tax free? Read more below to find out the details!<br></p><h3><strong>What makes the ABLE account unique and desirable?</strong></h3><p>The Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act of 2014 allows states to create tax-advantaged savings programs for eligible people with disabilities (designated beneficiaries). Funds from these 529A ABLE accounts can help designated beneficiaries pay for qualified disability expenses. Distributions are tax-free if used for qualified disability expenses, <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/government-entities/federal-state-local-governments/able-accounts-tax-benefit-for-people-with-disabilities\">per the IRS</a>.<br></p><p>Many families who have children with disabilities rely on a variety of different public (and governmental) programs and benefits including SSI, Medicaid waiver programs and SNAP. Eligibility for these programs, however, is based on certain income requirements and limits and can be withdrawn if an individual owns assets above those income limits. An ABLE account allows individuals with a disability to save and invest money without losing those federal benefits -- as long as the total balance does not exceed $100,000.<br></p><h3><strong>How is ABLE eligibility determined?</strong></h3><p>The ABLE Act limits eligibility to individuals with disabilities with an age of onset of disability before turning 26 years of age.<br></p><h3><strong>What can ABLE funds be used for?</strong></h3><p>This varies slightly by State and you should check the rules in the state you sign up in, but generally speaking:</p><ul><li>Education</li><li>Housing (including utilities and mortgage payments for guardians if the child lives at home)</li><li>Transportation</li><li>Employment training and support</li><li>Assistive technology</li><li>Personal support services</li><li>Health</li><li>Prevention and wellness</li><li>Financial management</li><li>Administrative services</li><li>Legal fees</li><li>Expenses for oversight and monitoring</li><li>Funeral and burial expenses<br></li></ul><h3><strong>Do the funds in the ABLE account grow?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Yes, Earnings on the account grow tax free as long as the funds are used for Qualified Disability Expenses.<br></p><h3><strong>Are &nbsp;limitations or restrictions on the ABLE account?</strong></h3><p>The total annual contributions by all participating individuals, including family and friends, for a single tax year is $15,000.<br></p><h3><strong>Can ABLE funds be moved to another 529 plan (college savings account)?</strong></h3><p>Yes, as of 2018 Congress passed the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1897\">ABLE Financial Planning Act</a> which allows you to rollover money from a 529 College Savings account into a beneficiary’s (or family member’s) ABLE account without being penalized and vice versa. There is a $15,000 rollover limit (less the current tax-year ABLE contributions).</p><h3><strong>What is the difference between an ABLE account and a Special Needs trust?</strong></h3><p>The regulations governing SNTs and ABLE accounts are quite different - individuals with disabilities and their families should consider their specific circumstances before establishing one or the other. In some instances, it may be beneficial to create both.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Some of the main difference between the two are listed below:</h3><h4>‍<strong>Eligibility</strong></h4><p><strong>ABLE</strong> The Act limits eligibility to an individual whose disability onset occurred prior to the age of 26</p><p><strong>SNT </strong>First party SNTs, which are funded with assets belonging to the beneficiary, must be established before an individual meeting Social Security’s disability criteria reaches the age of 65</p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Establishment &amp; Management</strong></h4><p><a href=\"https://www.specialneedsalliance.org/blog/how-to-open-an-able-account/\"><strong>ABLE</strong> accounts can be created and managed by the beneficiary, subject to capacity</a>. If they need assistance, the account can be established and/or managed by their parents, conservator/guardian or agent under a power of attorney.</p><p><strong>SNT </strong>A first party SNT may be established by the beneficiary, their parents, grandparents, conservator/guardian or the court. A third party SNT may be established by anyone <em>except </em>the beneficiary. Management of SNTs is handled by a designated trustee.</p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Contribution Limits</strong></h4><p><strong>ABLE</strong><em> Total </em>annual contributions are pegged at $15,000 at the moment</p><p><strong>SNT </strong>There are no limits to how many SNTs an individual may have or to how much each trust may hold.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Spending Restrictions</strong></h4><p><strong>ABLE</strong> An ABLE account may pay for the beneficiary’s “qualified disability expenses” (QDEs) to maintain or improve the health, independence, or quality of life of the beneficiary. This includes basic living expenses, education, housing, transportation, employment training and support, assistive technology, personal support services, health care expenses, financial management and administrative services. The ability to pay for housing without affecting SSI is an attractive benefit of ABLE accounts.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SNT</strong>, at the trustee’s discretion, may pay for anything that benefits the beneficiary alone─ other than food and housing─ without affecting government benefits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>How do I get started setting up an ABLE account?</strong></h4><p>Decide which State you will open the account in and set it up online.&nbsp; This site - <a href=\"https://www.ablenrc.org/compare-states/\">ABLENRC.org/compare-states/</a>&nbsp; allows you to compare different state programs and then click through to learn more about any given program and open an account.<br></p><p><strong>HAPPY PLANNING EVERYONE!</strong>‍<br></p>",

I talked myself out of the idea that these tiny twitches were something to be concerned about. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2RbwWfA7Gf/\" target=\"_blank\">Emmitt</a> had some previous concerns about autism and developmental delay, so we already had a neurologist at a private hospital in Pretoria, South Africa where we were living. Suspicious, I arranged an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography\" target=\"_blank\">EEG</a> and, much to my relief, no abnormal activity was found. Then one summer afternoon my sweet boy, chubby and full of smiles, had another eye flutter and his body went completely limp and fell to the ground.</p><p>What was once only visible to me quickly became evident to everyone else in our home. During meals, Emmitt’s eyes and face would twitch with nearly every bite. While we were waiting for a follow-up EEG he fell out of a chair while seizing and cut his eye. Within a matter of weeks, the nearly unnoticeable flutters became almost non-stop throughout the day. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"IMG_2099+%281%29.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7a416b02ad22daa4d42aa_IMG_2099%252B%2525281%252529.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>The next EEG revealed that he did indeed have epileptic activity and we started our very first medication, valproic acid. The flutters all but disappeared and I no longer feared him falling over without warning. I counted us among the lucky ones, having read that only some people with epilepsy get this kind of control with a single drug. Sadly, that’s not where Emmitt’s journey toward seizure control ended.</p><p>The journey soon became a race to outpace Emmitt’s worsening seizures, and we still have not reached the finish line. Six weeks later the flutters returned as if they had never gone away. More <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valproate\" target=\"_blank\">valproic acid</a>, then some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamotrigine\" target=\"_blank\">Lamotrigine</a>, always watching for the infamous rash. Somewhere early on—via the <a href=\"https://www.invitae.com/en/physician/tests/03401/\" target=\"_blank\">Invitae Epilepsy Panel</a>—the race got an official name: Syngap1, likely the first diagnosis on the African continent. Emmitt was 18 months old, it was May 2019. &nbsp;Repeat EEGs of fifteen minutes while sedated masked the true nature of what was going on in his brain. Slowly, the Lamotrigine went up and the seizures never went down. It was normal to count twenty to thirty eye flutters during his breakfast alone. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:683px\"><div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7a4168e433222b5a87489_image-asset.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>As I grew in my knowledge about epilepsy and began connecting with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SyngapGlobalFamilySupport/\" target=\"_blank\">other Syngap families</a>, I realized that Emmitt’s epilepsy was heading towards the severe end of the spectrum. I began pushing our neurologist for better follow-up and quicker responses. Even at a private hospital, there was no nurse practitioner staff to back up our neurologist by answering questions or making day-to-day adjustments to medications. I had to press for every single lab level that we ever got, guided by Dr. Google and fellow parents. Even in big South African cities, the need is so great and the number of professionals so small that this is regarded as normal. Calls to find other neurologists put us on waiting lists of six months to a year. One neurologist told me that we could not be seen because we our case needed too much follow-up.</p><p>A few months on, Emmitt’s seizures weren’t any better and I began to notice patchy red rashes showing up on his face. This led to the recommendation of a hasty withdrawal from Lamotrigine, replaced with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clobazam\" target=\"_blank\">Clobazam</a>. As the number of myoclonia doubled, head drops also began to reappear. The head drops became so severe that we had to buy a soft rug for our wood floors so that we could safely set him down. This in turn led to the introduction of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levetiracetam\" target=\"_blank\">Keppra</a>, and Keppra rage. Throughout all of this we never once saw his neurologist, even when I expressed panic that Emmitt’s seizures were numbering in the hundreds most days.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:720px\"><div><img alt=\"Emmitt1.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7a416ac83480c05c6fe49_Emmitt1.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p><br></p><p>No longer able to bear it, we arranged for an at-home EEG and the data was horrific. Drops every five to eight seconds. By that point, Emmitt had also developed a fever and we could tell something had been brewing in his lungs. Turns out the rash our neurologist never saw wasn’t from the medications after all. He was sick. As soon as the EEG was done, a friend and I packed a few things and headed for Johannesburg to find another neurologist through the emergency room. By that point I had been in touch with <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/team-profiles/mike-graglia\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Graglia</a> &amp; his wife <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/team-profiles/ashley-evans\" target=\"_blank\">Ashley Evans</a>, the founders of the Syngap Research Fund. </p><p>When I was messaging Mike he was at a <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/press/epmc2019\" target=\"_blank\">Precision Medicine Epilepsy Conference</a> with some of the best Neurologists in the US. &nbsp;As he tells it, he ran over to a member of the SRF <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/sab\" target=\"_blank\">Scientific Advisory Board</a> and asked who we should see. &nbsp;Emails flew and an hour later I was was directed &nbsp;towards a pediatric neurologist at Sunninghill Hospital. &nbsp;We spent nine days at that hospital titrating medications.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"IMG_20190925_124026 (1).jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7a4169d03f7315b22abac_IMG_20190925_124026%2B%25281%2529.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>We left Johannesburg in better shape than when we had arrived, bringing the drops down to about twenty per day. The doctors at the hospital told us that at home in America we would have access to newer drugs and technology for treating Emmitt’s severe epilepsy. In a whirlwind three weeks we packed up our entire lives (again) and Emmitt and I returned ahead of my husband and older two boys, hoping that we would be able to get settled before any further emergencies arose. </p><p>It was October 2019, Emmitt was about to turn 2, and I flew half way around the planet to bring him home, just praying for no serious seizures until we arrived. &nbsp;We avoided other children and public places until our American health insurance kicked in a few weeks later. At that point Emmitt was using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valproate\" target=\"_blank\">Depakote</a>, Onfi, a small dose of Lamotrigine, and the Modified Atkins diet to keep his seizures in check.</p><p>Half a year after our move home, we still haven’t achieved the elusive goal of “seizure control”, though we are making some progress. Now taking Depakote, Onfi, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol_(medication)\" target=\"_blank\">Epidiolex</a>, Emmitt is not having drops every day but does still have frequent eye myoclonia. Unfortunately, these medications also still need adjusting as the side-effects, including poor eating and drinking and lethargy, have made daily life really challenging. We go for frequent lab work to ensure his liver is ok with all these medications; have numerous EEGs and endless appointments as we work to see Emmitt thrive.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"IMG_20200422_084234.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7a416d57bcec0664d074a_IMG_20200422_084234.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Along the way, we were grateful to meet other Syngap families from around the world online.

We are appreciative that the challenges of being in a foreign country during Emmitt’s Syngap and epilepsy diagnoses were met with a community full of resilience, armed with knowledge, and brimming with hope as we advocate for effective treatments for Syngap.</p><p>Update, see the video Sydney &amp; Brett did about their first year with a SynGAP Diagnosis:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.25%\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wYrC77Mdtyw?wmode=opaque&enablejsapi=1\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></figure><p><br></p><p>‍</p>",

The paths traveled by the AS, Dravet and SCN2A communities provide a map to follow for the development of ASO therapy for SYNGAP1. &nbsp;The AS and Dravet communities have been very active in raising funds and driving scientific research. &nbsp;The AS group FAST recently created a company called GeNeTx and partnered with the leading rare disease pharmaceutical company Ultragenyx to create this ASO and get it to clinical trials. </p><p>Before a drug or potential therapy can move into clinical trials, basic principles need to be established such as showing the therapy is effective in the laboratory and in animal models, having clear measures to find out if the therapy helps people, and investigating safety. &nbsp;Biomarkers need to be established and a natural history study completed. &nbsp;Each step takes time. &nbsp;For rare diseases, especially neurodevelopmental diseases, time is precious. &nbsp;In fact, time is brain. &nbsp;</p><h2>INCREASE EXPRESSION</h2><p>Angelman Syndrome (AS) is caused by the loss or dysfunction of the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene, which results in a decreased production of ubiquitin protein ligase E3A in neurons. Clinical signs of AS are similar to SYNGAP1 Encephalopathy and include epilepsy, intellectual disability, gait abnormalities, and global speech and developmental delays. &nbsp;The ASO in clinical trials is called GTX-102 and it is designed to reactivate the paternal copy of the UBE3A gene, which is naturally silenced by an antisense transcript (UBE3A-AS). &nbsp;GTX-102 is designed to bind to the UBE3A-AS, which would inactivate the natural antisense and allow protein to be made for neurons in the central nervous system. &nbsp;The overall effect is to increase expression of ubiquitin protein ligase E3A in neurons. &nbsp;SYNGAP1 Encephalopathy is a haploinsufficiency and could be treated by increasing expression of SYNGAP1 protein in neurons, similar to the idea for AS.</p><h2>PUT TO THE TEST</h2><p>The current clinical trial for Angelman Syndrome is called &nbsp;“A Phase I/II Open-label, Multiple-dose, Dose-escalating Clinical Trial of the Safety and Tolerability of GTX-102 in Pediatric Patients With Angelman Syndrome (AS).” &nbsp; A phase I clinical trial tests a drug or treatment in a small group of people for the first time with the purpose to learn about the safety of the treatment and identify side effects. &nbsp;A phase II clinical trial tests the therapy in a larger group of people to determine effectiveness and continue to evaluate its safety. &nbsp;The first patient has been given the GTX-102 ASO. &nbsp;The current clinical trial is recruiting 20 pediatric patients total. For each individual patient the clinical trial will last about 6 months. &nbsp;The completion date for these phases is set to be January 2022. &nbsp; </p><p>The trial is described in rich detail <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04259281\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> &amp; there is more in the links at the end of this article.</p><p>What do we parents need to know? &nbsp;Here are 5 key takeaways:</p><ol><li>GTX-102 cannot theoretically cross the blood brain barrier, so it must be given directly into spinal fluid. &nbsp;The ASO will be given via lumbar puncture into the intrathecal space or CNS space. &nbsp;The injection will be given three times total at specific days in time for the study. &nbsp;</li><li>The study has three outcome measures (primary, secondary and other). &nbsp;The primary outcome measures are to determine the side effects or adverse events and the severity and incidence of the adverse events. </li><li>Secondary measures are to determine the total concentration of the drug at specific time points. &nbsp; The other outcome measures quantify the protein levels in the CSF (only at one time point per the description of the study). &nbsp;</li><li>At the end of the study exploratory outcome measures will determine if the ASO treatment was helpful. &nbsp;These measures evaluate changes in motor function, development, communication, seizure frequency, sleep, behaviors, and global clinical status. Validated scales and means are required to measure these outcomes for AS. &nbsp;</li><li>Eligible patients will be between 4-17 years old and meet all the screening and inclusion criteria and not meet any of the exclusion criteria.

His parents June and Fred on the right.</figcaption></figure><p>Joel Maurice was born in a small town in Iowa in the late 1940s. He was an uncannily happy baby, giggling and cooing at every turn. He had trouble learning to walk, though, and it wasn’t clear whether it was because of his lazy left eye. He didn’t speak much either during those early years; his brother John David, only 17 months older, would be his voice, telling all comers, “Joel wants...” </p><p>Joel was unsteady on his feet, and had trouble keeping pace with childhood games. He loved setting off fireworks with his cousins, he loved the Peanuts characters and he loved music. He would often sit away from the crowd, tapping his fingers to a beat only he could hear. </p><p>Soon John would go out to play with his friends, and Joel would almost always stay behind at home with their mother June. Sometimes the days would turn into weeks before they would leave the house. &nbsp;</p><p>Joel became adept at drumming, able to express all those beats in his mind. John traveled with his relatives to Europe, learned French, and went to college on the east coast. Meanwhile, Joel studied music at the local college, but the pressure overcame him. &nbsp;He was hospitalized and sent home to his parents, and sometimes the weeks would turn into months when he didn’t leave the house. When he did leave the house, at 6’5’’ and 280 lbs, he was sometimes taken in by the local police, just for looking scary. Hospitalizations and institutionalizations came and went, along with electric shock therapy and cocktails of drugs. Joel still loved Peanuts and he kept drumming.</p><p>John got married and had a baby. When his parents called, sometimes his lips would purse, words became terse, and he would hang up shaking his head, “Joelie, Joelie boy.” The boys wrote letters to each other, Joel’s handwriting getting shakier and his narratives harder to follow. June grew ill — they lost her in 1990. Joel continued to live with his dad Fred until Fred’s death in 2000. John found a group home for Joel and cleaned out their parents’ house — perfectly kept records showed a total of twenty-two hospitalizations and institutionalizations. In 2003, John and Joel gave Joel’s drum set away to his cousins; playing in their basement for the very last time, Joel lit up with joy. That next year, cancer began to spread through Joel’s body and they amputated his left hand. When his uncle came to visit him, he was still tapping away with his right hand. Joel died in 2006.</p><p>When I was a little girl, I had a favorite toy that was good at drumming — I called it “Crazy Uncle.” My mother made that toy disappear one day, and I never asked where it went. Until he lost his mother, I had never seen my father, John David, cry. Until my dad lost his father, I never heard him acknowledge his brother Joel’s suffering. But when my dad was dying in 2015, I would sometimes hear him say, again, “Oh, Joelie, Joelie boy.”</p><p>When my own son was diagnosed with SynGAP two years ago, it took a genetics lesson for me to conclude that my Uncle Joel could not have had SynGAP himself. But there was still a part of me that hoped that he had. Because that would have given me a way to understand him, to piece through the half-heard, half-understood tales I had been told from others; to connect, through my own, passionate, heart-filled son, to the mysterious boy and man that Joel was.</p><p>I know my grandparents stood by his side, and did what they believed was best for him, in an age where there were no meaningful diagnoses for neurological afflictions, no faithful scientists working on the problems, no therapists to stand by them to ease the suffering, and no hope for a cure.</p><p>Joel’s affliction was, and to this day remains, undiagnosed. He lived at a time when that undiagnosed life was one of heartbreaking loneliness. The days, weeks and months when Joel didn’t leave the house — I will never know how many of those times were days when he was not in the right state to face the world, or, rather, that he and his parents feared the world would turn its back on him.</p><p>As the mother of a diagnosed child, in an age where a diagnosis can bring hope, my wish for all our children is that their days and weeks, as much as possible, will be in the sunlight. That they will find friendships and will nurture their passions. And, in honor of Rare Disease day, in honor of all the undiagnosed Joels, I hope we can all take a moment to listen for all of them, and the beats of their own drums.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"Joel’s niece, Ashley with her sons, John (1) and Tony (6).

    "Post Body": "<p>‍<em>After years of searching, my family and I had almost given up on finding a diagnosis for my sister Caren, age 64. We had seen more than a hundred specialists, but her medical mystery had not been solved. We began to accept the fact that we may never answer the thousands of questions we carried in our minds, and we’d made peace with this fate. Yet on June 17th, 2020, we finally received the diagnosis of SynGAP1 from a genetic test administered by Dr. Darius Adams. Little did we know that Caren would become a symbol of hope for other families who are impacted by this rare disease.&nbsp;</em></p><h2><strong>The Miracles</strong></h2><p>Spring 2020 was truly an awful time for the world. Along with millions of other people, I thought I would lose a loved one to the pandemic. My sister, an epileptic, schizophrenic, intellectually disabled, and autistic individual contracted COVID-19 in March 2020. After several days of inpatient treatment at Saint Barnabas Hospital, my worst nightmare came true. Due to her inability to eat, Caren was placed on “comfort care.” In my adult life, I have always worked endlessly to arrange everything for my sister, but I never imagined I would be planning her funeral arrangements so soon. In the midst of this heartache, I received my first miracle in the form of a phone call - “She’s awake! She asked for food!”</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/608641c94a797947630fb5d2_X_HRvY5dxNxAY0YZ6bCa9z08iuTTyERa91RhfxxZUQVl-XPzucOE4mPu_6mOoZ30qNY0sP-quF633_dV2bzoy1dDEKsS3D2qv2Kl0HxqM4t-zIXxGFGuLts1N2Esft8_DnyHntDW.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>After an unbelievable turnaround, Caren was sent to regain her strength for 6 weeks at the Atrium Acute Care facility. I accredit her remarkable recovery to the staff at both the hospital and care facility. Day and night, incredible health care workers tried everything they could to treat her, and I will forever be grateful. Without these individuals, we would have never experienced our second, and greatest, miracle of this challenging year; <em>a SynGAP1 diagnosis.</em>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>My name is Nancy Kessler, and I am honored to share Caren’s SynGAP1 story. I am her younger sister, co-guardian, personal chef, Santa Claus, or whoever she wants me to be on a given day. I play many different roles in Caren’s life, but above all, I am Caren’s biggest fan!</p><p>As Caren’s co-guardian along with my youngest sister, I oversee her health and wellbeing. In 2015, my father decided it was in Caren’s best interest to transfer her guardianship to us, given his old age. Our mother passed in 2000, and our father in 2019, a year shy of Caren’s SynGAP1 diagnosis. We also have one brother, the second born, who lives in California. Geography has been a challenge for our family, especially with my younger sister now residing in Florida. I live close to Caren in New Jersey, and have been able to handle much of her care. A number of my responsibilities as a co-guardian include attending all medical appointments, providing yearly reports to the surrogate family court for Caren’s finances/wellbeing, buying clothing and necessities, spending holidays and quality time together, visiting her home and cooking her favorite meals. Despite the distance, it is up to the three of us to ensure that Caren is well attended to.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/608641c91dfb8522b1e5da48_-P2V9GMn2jc7nPldT0IgVjEKs1VWLtKVHTxwt-M00UyzJZVClZC-ihR9ktxELWmTO29y7euZSR66uUTBbacjyvMYJRREACqxpAOR6ruagD4sxsIwafvxjcb1sMwuYMYFcAtcycjs.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Caring for Caren has always come naturally to me. When I was little, I tried my best to help my mother whenever possible. I developed a nurturing and giving personality from caring for her at a young age, and I have always felt a tremendous sense of responsibility towards her. It is no surprise that I ultimately became a teacher and later worked on a child study team, where I had the opportunity to manage children with special needs. I dedicated 35 years of my life to education and the special needs community. I believe my background as a caretaker bolstered my career, as I was able to understand and empathize with children and their families on a deeper level. I devote my success in my work to being Caren’s sister.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/608641c981398675199bc70c_a3homPCNOn7_jyBS0_2XiAoHDdvumIpQqQX9L7V59gT6NWtA8P7sHP0WTuPBT3kkF752T3QSq4TvU8bONqMZa92fZtUxPyiRs_ohK2fRy-DpUyN_Ph4RVPFZQ7Tsq-rYPA1qPFZN.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>I may be biased, but Caren is a pleasure to look after. Her laugh is contagious, but her sarcastic humor catches people by surprise. Caren observes everything and doesn’t miss a beat. She can be strong willed and will always let you know what she wants. Although I am Caren’s sister, I have a strong maternal attachment to her. She knows I love her and I would do anything for her! Caren’s life has not always been easy, but her SynGAP1 diagnosis is worthwhile!<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/608641cb5154917e542476da_pb7LYJs8EVXkseas4ou1_k7m3c80EZzUlbPSvIBWkIroHti7As7QhgPEbhMRppgv6h1n2flKOimZ88D0ppLOLkBjEeloy7uIoMuPmWhsBgQg7rHnrH5qiYqDnwTvDrQRQuUQOpR-.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2>‍<strong>Caren’s History</strong></h2><p>Caren received her very first diagnosis of a congenital foot deformity after her birth in 1956. It seems almost silly now, given the weight of all of her other symptoms and struggles in her life. As one of four children, Caren’s behaviors were perhaps most difficult on my mother. Even with a babysitter and advice from doctors, my mother felt as though she could never catch a break. As an infant, Caren missed many milestones and experienced her first seizure at 7 months old. Not only was my mother disheartened by her mysterious set of symptoms, but the doctors who had advised her were at a loss as well.&nbsp;<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/608641c9515491aa122475e7_q9uDLpe8fFp9y2ZYBK1lKQp7bqCq-pxAcZVj6jtwfQUVVBx_Na-5UG3xs6oQ9jg_-Sv_P5Qz71FhBryCvPPcC42_EJ-jmTeKct2g23boRGB4LhQiTKJvXYyqwqPI75mOxUhlqJqX.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>At 6 years old, Caren was diagnosed with moderate intellectual disability and mental retardation secondary to congenital cerebral defect. At such a young age, Caren’s behaviors and symptoms were unmanageable. It’s important to understand Caren’s symptoms within the context of our times. This was not 2021, where schools are legally mandated to support and educate children with disabilities under Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. This was the 1960s, a far cry from the age of expected disability rights that we know today. Disabled individuals, even children, were more often than not “sent away” or segregated -- not by the families, but by the institutions themselves. Standard schooling was not an option. My parents tried their best to make it work at home, despite little help or support from the state. Given the societal norms and lack of accommodations, my parents had no choice but to place Caren under the watch of those more qualified to manage her behaviors at a residential school in North Jersey.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/608641c94893b9469d901d01_s7Wkvyxy6y2Vq-XjOIAoLfVYf7SG2U0kcVItxVD7hMu5Dzrm87leTQmqwyYeIAgc0C97SILxZ98Wx7ZN1U-HuXOnfDyok62viZu3-slbfa85W2Ykw42LVT0LEy6dC3jn-OuzrnzW.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>At age 8, Caren returned home in order to visit a series of specialists, including a neurologist and psychiatrist in Philadelphia. They recommended an ambitious course of specialized learning activities and exercises called “patterning,” to be administered in the home with help from members of our community. The prescribed treatment was designed to retrain the brain with specific movements such as crawling, and repetitive educational activities. Today, the extension of this type of treatment can be found at the <a href=\"https://iahp.org/about/\">Philadelphia-based Institute for Human Potential</a>. Caren learned to read phonetically, complete simple math and write single words.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/608641c9e15671b5a6b460d4_9EhDTQyYxtho1I8J-To6K0F8q9YVwkmIWYi5oOHUwNkZ16v7P9P69N2iXaNX6NC_F7dsVW7X240TRgqzFKjR8qx7u44NIvt1Fi9A9BdrAuwnH1HJvnu01bjGaNGg3MtNToHExo9x.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Although Caren learned many critical skills during her childhood, her severe behaviors were not subdued. My parents never gave up on her, as they kept advocating for her care. From the ages of 11 to 17, my parents placed Caren in a residential school for Catholic girls in Pennsylvania. During this time, her behaviors became more bizarre and she was diagnosed with <em>organic brain dysfunction</em>. Even in her early childhood, I remember witnessing Caren bound into a straightjacket in residential placements -- an intervention they commonly used to restrain patients in an effort to keep them and others safe. Unfortunately, her temper, aggression and tendencies accelerated in her teens and were overwhelming for the staff.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/608641c9f4646ff3bfb2c262_v58Xcw8L8vnniX6itiOwAPFLVHJrIVAO88WRBTa-xTl9ZPd5RmwPJqXlGffXZR-pBqea6AJpnNZh7aARS6co2u7c_5r8GljMCcjSx8Sjg9VTSMDZ2Hvp-dXnIFMxOT1irg5UM5xB.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>My parents never gave up on her, and they kept pushing the medical community to produce answers and provide support for Caren. Upon turning 18 and with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, Caren was taken to see Dr. William Beecher Scoville in Hartford, Connecticut. At the time, the only way to advocate for Caren was to undergo an experimental treatment for her condition, or else she would have remained in the back wards of institutions in a straightjacket. Therefore, a lobotomy was the only option.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/608641c9be380b9f0c5612e1_Z89EILYRf-WpInCd3bylQgC-lP_QXhe7sff7g8JDfGq51CpicTlxVJh7an0c4mo9_sPxwKq1_aVgTBhqHzxUdySA_5rbHNMMlbVp1WFBUaS1QxjitumwAkubSnsJHg9rxpgG35WI.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>A lobotomy is a neurosurgical treatment of a mental disorder that involves severing the connections of the brain’s prefrontal cortex. Filled with desperation and unwavering hope, my parents accepted the treatment. The specific procedure performed is called a “modified” frontal lobotomy with orbital undercutting. Dr. Scoville was initially hesitant and advised placing Caren on other medications for seizures; however, he was convinced to complete this surgery by the desperate pleas from my parents and her doctors. Ironically, Dr. Scoville had performed a similar procedure on an infamous patient, H.M., where the effects and biological underpinnings of anterograde amnesia were investigated.&nbsp;<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/60897f56f775aa1f57046857_C14bZhXAVRlBYciTytZ9eH-qwxavoMpOwvTu4qEnogGjx6-083_OiY0VEA0ku2zGbVJY1Ef7b8yf4gmXQKcrkQcXr276wv05-5XeZANzV39MZHVFdqHKFACouwRZI8xC1ws6efX8.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>While my parents always questioned the surgery and the overall success, we suspect that Caren experiences a degree of anterograde amnesia.

In recent years, deinstitutionalization became a major threat to the facility.

Prior to the pandemic, Caren visited my home as frequently as twice a month, and I still visit her very often! When she is not able to visit us, we FaceTime a few times a week. The staff at her home and day program are wonderful individuals, and have facilitated our communication during this uncharted time. Not only has the pandemic changed Caren’s life, but her newly found diagnosis has opened new doors for her as well.&nbsp;<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/608641c974ae1d99a45e9260_n8xjUN81CSN60pzFT_1Inm3c4M4J8BmivnZih8glnQQdJ3Fjo4eB8-vekmzhig5d2rJHA6Kc70N75zURlecA2jdZOmlKyPlYNKccDyuAbh-7I0dU7KWImJow3NfZYBSAX4-EouMC.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2><strong>SynGAP1 Diagnosis</strong></h2><p>Caren’s diagnosis story is certainly one of a kind. Caren’s geneticist, Dr. Darius Adams, hoped to identify the genetic influences on her overwhelming symptoms; intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), seizure disorder and other behaviors. Although we were not particularly optimistic, we decided to move ahead with testing in September 2019 -- before the pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>Caren’s first round of genetic testing was called a chromosomal microarray (CMA). Illumina describes <a href=\"https://www.illumina.com/areas-of-interest/genetic-disease/rare-disease-genomics/cma-constitutional-cytogenetics.html\">CMA</a> as being able to identify “structural chromosomal aberrations and provide insight into causative relationship anolmolies.” The CMA test came back negative, but Dr. Adams was persistent about further testing. After all, what did we have to lose at this stage in her diagnostic journey?&nbsp;</p><p>Following the CMA, Dr. Adams wanted to try Trio Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), which is typically administered to parents and their child. Given that our parents had already passed, my younger sister and I participated in the test with Caren. According to Illumina, <a href=\"https://www.illumina.com/techniques/sequencing/dna-sequencing/targeted-resequencing/exome-sequencing.html\">Whole Exome Sequencing</a> “involves sequencing the protein-coding regions of the genome.” With much anticipation, we finally received a diagnosis of SynGAP1! In combination with my joy from Caren’s survival from COVID-19, I was so filled with emotion. After almost 65 years, we finally pieced together my sister’s health puzzle. <em>Now</em> we understood.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/608641caf4646f464ab2c2a8_UMKoaOfIVn1dwo7vNcwgVZbdSbUssxmBLoP1iowTPePD047hlvINcjZtvOG0enAXGMGbv8xOhLwXnYqnqdRP3smeNhPMXtnq0pE-4hZnEg8gl-dcRX2EPALyIIzFb3DvlY2c2NQC.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), <a href=\"https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/syngap1-related-nsid/\">SynGAP1-related NSID</a> (non-syndromic intellectual disability), first reported in 2009, is a sporadic condition caused by “<em>de novo </em>(spontaneous, non inherited) mutations.” Symptoms vary between individuals and include intellectual disability (moderate to severe), varying degrees of epilepsy and/or autism spectrum disorders (ASD), mild hypotonia (low muscle tone), global developmental delays, speech delays, oral dyspraxia, and physical aggression (hitting, biting). Two thirds of the children also have seizures, which may be controlled through the use of anticonvulsant medications. Many SynGAPians are also diagnosed with attention deficit disorders, impulsivity and/or mood disorders.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>Throughout her life, Caren has displayed all of these symptoms. Her earlier diagnoses included mental retardation, organic brain dysfunction, speech delays, motor delays, seizures, schizophrenia, global developmental delays, autism, severe to moderate intellectual disability, and severe aggression.&nbsp;<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/608641ca47b0466073d183c3_kFtDWVdtcLFmBbcvCO62_mx6z6nlWz4PsPleyopilWPezBiKULaqwJ2sMHlXI18OMaOujOoPq_Ps-sQOGhaVPQIxR9LwmPmcsW3uGz1o4SVMtKZcdJmSN0MtWY2CFBtm2GMeqEgv.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Although my parents were unable to witness this breakthrough in Caren’s diagnostic journey, I believe they would have felt relieved that we have found an answer. My only regret is that they never knew, despite their continuous support and relentless advocacy. They always thought Caren’s behaviors and cognitive delays were somehow their fault, but they would be amazed to learn about her SynGAP1 diagnosis today.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The Next Steps</strong></h2><p>Once Caren was diagnosed, I didn’t know where to begin. I was determined to learn as much as I could about SynGAP1, and I spent many long nights researching the condition. I eventually stumbled upon one of the SynGAP1 groups on Facebook and introduced Caren and me to the group. Naively, I figured I would connect with other caretakers of older SynGAPians, but this was not the case. Through my own research and with input from the members on the page, I soon realized that very little is known about older adults with SynGAP1 pathogenic variants.&nbsp;</p><p>As you can imagine, many parents must have long searched for information on the aging SynGAPian. I tried my best to answer a plethora of questions surrounding Caren and SynGAP1 at her age. The parents and I also exchanged stories, and the site soon turned into an anecdotal database for SynGAP1.&nbsp;</p><p>I have met the most incredible parents from the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SyngapResearchFund/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook group</a>, including Jess from <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org\" target=\"_blank\">the SynGAP Research Fund (SRF)</a>. We discussed the idea of creating a film about Caren, and I could not resist. This project soon became a reality, and Mike Graglia, co-founder of SRF with his wife, Ashley Evans, connected me with Daniel Defabio, the co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.thedisordercollection.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The DISORDER Channel</a>. As the director of this film, Daniel was a wonderful person to work with. He is a professional, a calming force, and a creative planner. We had created a phenomenal team for this project and we could not wait to get filming.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/608641cb0217e026d9c1a7bf_DbkiMv3qSfV7ukYQSl3lJeqr7qEwFoWIsCJbTSCtZ3p-DjcEUDq8MQE0ZtT0xUqbs8nmg4juoCg4frDKig2wCtlsCtwiRrOpX4yrNxfZSP1edOWp5-KwOzGGwqI_Mw9zucRuI0aW.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Caren was ecstatic to learn that she would become a “movie star!” She loves being the center of attention, and is a “girly-girl” at heart. Happily preparing for her time in front of the camera, Caren picked out a dress, wore make-up and earrings, and sat still for her manicure! Filming was a lovely bonding experience, and we made sure to celebrate Caren in the process. (Read <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/meeting-caren-interview-with-jess-duggan-syngap1\">Jess’s article about the day</a>) With this in mind, we came up with the perfect name for the film: <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/caren\"><em>Celebrating Caren</em></a>.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><h2><strong>Looking Ahead and Making a Difference&nbsp;</strong>‍</h2><p>My goal in creating <em>Celebrating Caren</em> was to make a difference. I wanted to reach families that are yet to have a diagnosis, as I can attest to how difficult this journey can be. I know there are more “Carens” out there, and they need to be found. In addition, Caren is a story of hope for SynGAP families. This community needs to know that their children have the potential to live long and happy lives like Caren. Long-term planning is a must for these families, as they need to begin to think about guardianship and needs trusts for the future. For Caren, our family prepared these documents with the help of an experienced special needs attorney, prior to both parents being deceased.&nbsp;<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><a href=\"http://syngap.fund/caren\" target=\"_blank\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/60897f571c28a64813d2347f_whKt43rzCdkNMR6QbBa0371CmCH27cphQ11CzB07OmkDd3nmGk5DPFtnD1a05lLqhABUo3SyyPYq4e9bRxeycdUhXhGiQAUgc-XQ-ibpdbawzcgaXCq_a_eoCk64AUfNFo6BR8vl.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></a></figure><p>Caren’s SynGAP1 diagnosis changed everything for us. Thanks to the Facebook group, we have been able to find amazing specialists that are familiar with the condition. I have also been introduced to tools such as <a href=\"https://www.ciitizen.com/\">Ciitizen</a> Natural History Studies that have greatly impacted the way I navigate Caren’s health. Ciitizen allows not only me, but also health professionals to access Caren’s medical records. This platform has been a life saver for doctor visits and has given her the opportunity to participate in research. A simple diagnosis can spark a domino effect for science, and we need to identify every SynGAPian out there! SRF has been a powerful force in this arena. Through funding research <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/professionals/grants/current-grants\">grants</a>, SRF is making potential treatment possible for SynGAPians. One hundred percent of <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/donate/donate\">donations</a> goes towards research that matters, and I cannot wait for the future of this organization and SynGAP1.&nbsp;</p><p>Genetic testing can move mountains for a patient and science as a whole, but it has impacted me in ways I could have never imagined. I am so thrilled to now be part of a greater community. As Caren’s primary caretaker, I have often found myself to be a lone wolf, seeking answers to a targeted set of questions. Being a caretaker is draining at times, but through social media and SRF, I no longer feel so alone. I am surrounded by an entourage of equally passionate and understanding individuals. I would like to personally shout out a big thank you to SRF, who have been my total support from the beginning, especially Mike Graglia and his wife Ashley Evans, along with the Board of Directors and Illumina! Their support and unwavering commitment have made this journey so special.&nbsp;<em>‍</em></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/608641ca2757ae3a7e24d463_4tn95-vyjPfwOIN_OJIzeetjQ9LnJLTMusuZxBYz1TQLfVpmeBbh_xmqCo434OmNdJSCJ7R_6QkNPo6s-CRZLXzOclI_wq-6ZrNMZ0E545ismLTU5iya3UVZa6I4zydJY-VF5B5-.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p><a href=\"http://syngap.fund/caren\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Celebrating Caren</em></a> is so much more than just my sister’s story.

Prior to intervention, whenever a face mask was presented to him, whether in close proximity or someone wearing it, aggressive episodes were a legitimate concern. If you were wearing a mask, Jaxon would start by not looking at you, put his head down, gesture confusion and discomfort with his facial expressions, and then launch into a fast and heavy grab . He then would vocalize, and get close to your face until you took the mask off. If a face mask was presented to him, he would say “no,” shake his head “no”, and leave the area entirely. Sometimes, he would even grab it and throw it if he felt annoyed enough to actually touch the mask.&nbsp;</p><p>When the masking order was put into place, I found out about it through <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/team/monica-cruz-harding-california-and-surrounding-states\">Monica</a>, Jaxon’s mom! There was absolutely no delay between her finding out and her messaging me about it, haha! I responded and said “okay, let’s get Jaxon to wear a mask then. We’ll work on it” to which she responded “yeah, good luck! You will never get my kid to wear a mask,” and here he is wearing a mask, rocking Covid times, and taking names!&nbsp;</p><p>My point here is that Jaxon was nowhere near a level in which he could successfully wear a face mask! If you think that your child’s conditions are not conducive, whatsoever, to teach him/her the skill, just know that Jaxon’s were not either, and he did it anyway. In order to reach success, we had to systematically plan for skill development and ultimately broke down his learnings into the following goal and objectives, while significantly leveraging 2 key strategies: use of social stories and shaping. See the details below:</p><h2><strong>Goal</strong></h2><p>Jaxon will wear a face-mask for prolonged periods of time within the next 1.5 months.</p><h2><strong>Objectives</strong></h2><ol><li>Enhancing Jaxon’s understanding of rationale for wearing face-mask</li><li>Tolerating others wearing a face mask</li><li>Tolerating wearing a face mask on self</li><li>Establishing Rules and Expectations</li></ol><h2><strong>Key Strategies Used</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://chicagoabatherapy.com/articles/social-stories-help-pediatric-aba/\">Social stories</a> are individualized short stories about social situations that the child may encounter. Social Stories are a therapeutic technique, often used with children on the Autism spectrum, that foster the exchange of information with the child that are highly personalized and illustrated. Many caregivers and therapeutic professionals find Social Stories to be especially helpful when trying to describe events, activities, social norms and managing expectations (Adams et al., 2004; Gray &amp; Garand, 1993).</p><p>Our social story was a crucial aspect of our intervention because we truly individualized it for Jaxon. The trick about social stories is understanding that any story with OUR language will mean absolutely nothing to your child. A story with words and concepts he/she doesn’t understand will be just that, words. The key is to create a story your child can relate to. The way in which your child relates to people, objects and events needs to be identified first. Jaxon has an incredible memory, and loves pictures. So, I used pictures of him, his family, and things he knows.&nbsp; I used the pictures to create&nbsp; the message I wanted to teach.<em> See below for a&nbsp; more detailed description of how we used social stories.&nbsp;</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.unl.edu/asdnetwork/virtual-strategies/shaping\">Shaping </a>is a process that reinforces close approximations to the behavior we want to see (Cooper, Heron &amp; Heward, 2019). We shaped wearing a face mask by requiring little increments each time and rewarding the small successes instead of requiring the whole thing at once. For example: requiring Jaxon to wear the mask for 5 seconds, then 10 seconds, and slowly increase the duration until the desired time.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/60202226f38ee718aab7ed48_4hbpGgAPIfNdgV4c4YvZZ7xHbryxmmquwmd8n1mTIJbXwo8_Umh_Uk0ag_YKF3mdRrzHHxBKH5d86do0nqZ7hO8HGgO48lhjXi1f0YGG6Q_WCpjcnH9aVSBU4caftXOUDWeRNZU.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3><strong>Objective 1: Enhancing Jaxon’s understanding of rationale for wearing face-mask</strong></h3><ol><li>The first social story we presented was a “Coronavirus” social story. We taught about Coronavirus, reasons for not going to school, and the inability to access preferred things and places. We taught page by page, relating everything to Jaxon. Once he demonstrated some receptive understanding we introduced the face mask social story.</li><li>The face mask story included several pages (more than 10). We began with talking about one page only! (We wanted him to not lose interest and be rewarded quickly). Then we added a second page, and a third, until we were able to go over the whole story in one sitting.&nbsp;</li><li>As we were going over each of the pages in the story, we would take discrete and particular messages and relate it to things he understood (a very important step in the process). We did not just read the story out loud, instead we would pause and show him via actions, additional words, objects or pictures what the message meant (see below for examples).&nbsp;</li><li>Outside of the social story time, we would talk about the places that he really enjoyed going to, and the reasons why they were currently “unavailable.” We did that by relating those instances back to the story. For example, we would say things like “Oh yeah boomers! It’s not available. Remember? People are sick (mock a sneeze). So, they have to clean it (show pictures of Jaxon’s preferred animated show that talks about germs)” or statements like that.</li><li>Within the story, wearing a face mask was introduced. Jaxon’s sister was amazing and put a mask on a bunch of images of Jaxon’s preferred items and sent them my way. Additionally, I had everyone in his family including his ABA team take pictures of themselves wearing masks and I included those in the story.&nbsp;</li><li>Once he was familiar with the story and he showed some receptive understanding of the situation, we introduced tolerating a face mask on others, as well as himself.</li></ol><h3><strong>Objective 2: Tolerating others wearing a face mask</strong></h3><p>We started by priming Jaxon before we put a face mask on. Specifically, we would have the mask in hand and say “Hey Jaxon! I just want to let you know that I am putting my mask on, okay?” and we would require him to acknowledge it by saying “yes” or giving us a thumbs up. Acknowledging was important as that indicated he received the message, and he agreed to it. This establishes a sense of accountability. We would put the mask on, and at the beginning we would keep it on for 5 seconds, reward, then 10 seconds, reward, until we could wear it for extended periods of time in Jaxon’s presence and he was no longer fazed by us wearing it.</p><h3><strong>Objective 3: Tolerating wearing a face mask on self</strong></h3><p>As mentioned above, we used shaping, so we broke this objective into smaller skills and rewarded each step of the way. The steps we followed were:</p><ol><li>Tolerating mask in close proximity (3-4 ft away)</li><li>Tolerating mask being closer and closer (2 ft, 1 ft, inches, next to him, almost touching him)</li><li>Touching the mask with his hand</li><li>Putting one loop of the mask on one ear</li><li>Putting both loops of the mask on each ear while keeping the covering by his chin</li><li>Putting mask over mouth and nose</li><li>Once he was putting the mask on properly, we started increasing the duration of wearing the mask. After he would put the mask on (with our help), we would require him to keep it on and we counted with him. We started at 5 seconds, and we increased it as follows: 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and we stopped counting (and he wasn’t taking it off anymore!).</li></ol><p>It is important to note 2 things related to the list of skill-builders above:</p><p>First, time between each of the skills (and thus, time it takes to develop or build each of the above skills) will vary from child to child. Consider similar skills you have attempted to develop with your child and time it took to build that skill. Furthermore, exposure and frequency of opportunity to work on each skill also influences the time it takes to develop the skill.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, if maladaptive behaviors occur, it would be advisable to first find out why. What happened before and after? What do we think it is? What about the intervention presents a barrier? And with that information make adjustments. If maladaptive behaviors occur, it is important to take a step back, or as many as needed where the behavior is not occurring and go from there.</p><h3><strong>Objective 4: Establishing Rules and Expectations</strong></h3><p>Once Jaxon acquired the skill, we made wearing a face mask a requirement (expectation) for any preferred or desired item. Below are a few important notes on actions we consistently had to take:</p><ul><li>We constantly reminded him, and continue to do so! Every time we go out in the community&nbsp; the mask is a requirement, and he needs to follow those directions. We repeat it on a consistent basis.&nbsp;</li><li>We also point out people wearing a mask, all the time! “Look Jaxon! He is wearing a mask, he is being safe” or statements of the sort.&nbsp;</li><li>We point out when we are putting our masks on. For example: “Jaxon! I am going to put my mask on and then I will come help you, okay? I need my mask to be safe” or such.</li><li>We also followed through and continue to do so with the expectation. For example: if we go to get a smoothie to Jamba Juice, the rules/expectations are: if you want your smoothie “keep mask on,” if he follows through, he gets his smoothie, if he does not, he won’t. If at any given point he takes the mask off, we do not follow through with the outing. Example: walking to Jamba Juice, takes mask off, “Okay, no mask, no smoothie! Back to the car” or such.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Once the skill was acquired, it simply became an expectation, and we don’t budge. He either has to wear it, or he has to wear it!</li></ul><h2><strong>Detailed Description of Our Use of Social Stories:</strong></h2><p>As I mentioned earlier, the social story was a very important aspect of our intervention. It was very effective due to the level of individualization of the story and how we ensured the messages related to things, people, and events Jaxon understood and remembered. We did a coronavirus and a face mask story.&nbsp;</p><p>From the Coronavirus social story there is this page with a picture of Jaxon when he was sick. Typically, when Jaxon does not feel well and gets sick with the common cold, he signs “sad” as a way to communicate that he does not feel well.

Also, his favorite drink from his favorite place (Carl’s Jr.) has a face mask on! We paired positive things that mattered a lot to him such as the Carl’s Jr. cup with the negative parts of wearing a mask.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/602600cc33aa044c3fe0f053_b-E1JzGagdq9q9zlCsP11qZlyjGZtW2CpAoIs2B3zyYmxVVV29M5J14ju2n9E7dBxEYA_Ojk_OPljCDIZvH_LSzzS3Qhl5_4ZWpnUVN_5CpUpaY5U0vuObADULPUQg.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Here we explained what the mask consists of.

Again, associating familiar people (positive) with the mask.<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/602600cbbab05a68aea05bc3_hjbFVVdDSz7tgIGrUTch7mUPXL5ccjptzvJrSwdJXIV9w-jZcnGsDrlIcY8PXcVakwLT91AgHv_7e0uJkTSIOuzo7x1KCIGM71ZxQZE3bhkqZPY9Om5joImgRVBZZA.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>This simply introduces that the more we do it the more comfortable we get with it. Additionally and most importantly, these two pictures are the front cover of two magazines that Jaxon loves with a mask!

We would look at pictures of people with different face masks and show him. Also Jaxon is into puppies! So, of course, we have a puppy with a mask to make it a positive thing.&nbsp;<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/602603a35584e3a4258fab82_Nw8pjD0iuIb9JPJr51qcjutHTMZi5WjnHe5rjMl6cTX4mQwTMpFErEZtvAo0oD5bmlZnHVndj6vz0aMYrw4-nJjVsd3tVuDBd473LSBIBkzT7BFdkt-fSG8aqQFHMw.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Jaxon identifies doctors, and relates to them well. So, we wanted him to relate the difference. Additionally, he talks about animals a lot due to his particular interest in the zoo and the carrousel. Jaxon particularly likes talking about horses with Monica because her horse noises are hilarious!! And Jaxon really enjoys them! Therefore, Monica thought adding a horse to the mix was appropriate (it also gave the rest of us a good laugh!).</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/602603a34dbe21f35ae2cd56_NWGkc22Jq0cwciJHs0dixze3eGtgjhcgQ85fi1KcrguQu6UlvWPl004V6LzCLTargofrhfXE4wgDdd8el3boMFKRP3mGJMvj4yW0ncS9977oUiw66hmGUkW2ocHk4w.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Here we introduced the community aspect of wearing a mask. To this point, we got Jaxon to understand that there is a virus, that we needed to wear a mask that may be uncomfortable, and now, we needed him to know why? Why does it matter? Well, because if you want to go into the community, you have to be safe. We explained this by showing him YouTube videos of his favorite places, or places he often went to and referred back to wearing a mask if we wanted to visit those places.<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/602603a40e795994eb1eac57_5ZhvknRG7DA4WnV1LJlSYJPa_87YCNtX-ZAirROOHyc5Wu9mGmjzOKzs0EvdpQGUM4Blu9Q0hyOMSNv1yKH5ry4Menbne-q0rl9OfxB3ReapQHFw4ulfD2gathO4lg.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Here we just added that everyone is wearing a mask! And we put some familiar pictures to normalize the act of wearing a mask and also making it positive.<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/602603a4ce407c214debb261_8al11hD2Kt7sdLanzBHi-f6WbgC08uNJ5bQ2NmGeQdBZCf23J2v2OBDTr-89X4RolCiLqYCtbhOtWNt8H39VAONz96FfvY2uP7rytG7CRxo5zCgoUNzyKDOxdfmJzg.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Here we continued to add that we want to be safe, and not be sick and therefore sad. The two ladies in the picture are Jaxon’s ABA therapists wearing a mask!<br></p><p>This sums it all up. Jaxon wearing a face mask keeps him and those around him safe, it makes him a functional member of society, it gives him access to things and places he could potentially not have access to without it, and at the very least, it provides him with an extra shield to protect him against potential exposure. It also gives Monica and Aaron some peace of mind!</p><p>I truly hope you find this information helpful, and I highly encourage you to see the possible in the impossible.

Prior to joining the leadership of SRF, Aaron was on the board of another SynGAP organization and was a co-PI on a smaller registry.</em></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"Click here, join this registry!\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7b36f7e4b281666c80771_Simons1.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Click here, join this registry!</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Executive Summary</strong>: Recently, SynGAP Research Fund, Inc (SRF) connected with Simons Variation in Individuals Project — Simons VIP — to talk about what they are doing for our community, and we are excited to report back to you. There is a well funded, professionally run, world-class registry available to our community. All we have to do is join!</p><p><strong>Good questions</strong>: What’s the catch? (There isn’t one) Are they going to sell our data? (Definitely not) How does this work? (You sign up, they do the rest). We asked all these questions. The reason for all this good news is that Simons VIP is a part of SFARI (Simons Foundation for Autism Research Initiative). SFARI’s mission is to improve the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders by funding innovative research of the highest quality and relevance.</p><p>According to SFARI there are 1,036 genes associated with autism. SYNGAP1 is in the top 25 genes classified as “high-confidence.” Since SynGAP is highly related to ASD, SFARI is investing in a registry of SynGAPians to better understand our disease.</p><p>The following are five reasons why the Simons VIP SynGAP1 data registry stands to advance SynGAP1 patient and therapeutic research opportunities for years to come:</p><ol><li><strong>It’s Fully Funded. </strong>Check out the Simons Foundation’s most recent annual report (<a href=\"https://www.simonsfoundation.org/report2017/stories/\" target=\"_blank\">2017</a>) and head over to <a href=\"https://www.simonsfoundation.org/report2017/financials/\" target=\"_blank\">financials</a>: $3.3 billion of assets. Which they are investing in brain research. (Thank goodness for Jim and Marilyn Simons, that’s all we can say.) But most importantly, you will never be asked to support this registry and they won’t ever try to monetize your data.</li><li><strong>They do lots of work — interviews &amp; followups</strong>. SVIP has a genetic counselor on staff who calls you for the survey. Aside from being convenient, <em>this makes for better data</em>. Think about a few other Syngap parents, especially when first diagnosed and imagine how they might answer the same question differently. All that self-reported data in a registry isn’t always useful. Imagine instead if all those people were talking to a Genetic Counselor who could help to normalize their responses. That improves the quality of data and makes it available for researchers.</li><li><strong>They follow up, every year</strong>. SynGAP patients change considerably in a year. Being able to take a snapshot and follow their progression will be crucial for developing a better understanding of the disease. SVIP calls you every year and schedules an update call — with a salaried professional at no cost to you — to update the story on your patient. It’s remarkably convenient.</li><li><strong>Multiple Languages, More Data. </strong>Simons VIP stated in early 2019 that they’ll be introducing four languages — Dutch, French, German, and Spanish. This is important both because it will help this registry have a global data sample, but also because it demonstrates the commitment of SVIP. Doing surveys in five languages isn’t cheap.</li><li><strong>They do seizures too</strong>! Wait, Simons is doing this because they care about autism, but our kids have seizures, so will this be useful to researchers focusing on seizures? Yes. SVIP has heard this feedback and is incorporating a set of seizure questions to be of service to SynGAP and the many other autism-related mutations that come with epilepsy.</li><li><strong>SVIP connects Patients &amp; Scientists</strong>. Simons VIP Connect will assist clinicians and researchers to contact families who are interested in research about studies that they may want to learn more about or consider joining. At all times however, patient privacy is a protected and no information is shared without the patients’ permission.</li></ol><p><strong>Interviews are powerful.</strong> If you haven’t read our <a href=\"https://medium.com/@syngapfund/syngap-patient-neurology-paper-five-things-parents-need-to-know-7910e6b95ce2\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> on <em>SYNGAP1 encephalopathies</em> by Vlaskamp, DRM, et al. (2018), don’t miss it. The paper was the result of a research team interviewing 57 patients and identified two novel types of seizures that are specific to SynGAP. And that was with just 57 interviews — imagine what researchers could learn if we all contributed to the SVIP registry and let them call us once a year to keep it current and develop data on our kids that spanned years.</p><p><strong>Action Step:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.simonsvipconnect.org/component/content/article.html?id=259\" target=\"_blank\">Go join SVIP! There is loads of information as well as the option to either register or request a phone call at the bottom. As a community, we are lucky to have such a valuable resource, and we ought to use it. Thank you.</a></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.25%\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/amYViu9WIlU?wmode=opaque&enablejsapi=1\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></figure><p>Check out this presentation from Simons VIP last year, we skipped the intro and take you right to the good stuff!</p><p>Share</p><p><br></p>",

After all, he’s equally motivated as we are to find a treatment for his brother, Yonas. At first I was not particularly enthusiastic about the idea, because—let’s be real—how much money could you possibly raise selling a cup of lemonade? Regardless, I decided to support Aayan’s enthusiasm, as I figured it could be an opportunity for him to hone certain skills. With a little bit of prep and planning (e.g. putting together posters and flyers, gathering together of supplies, working on putting together a “pitch”, juicing of lemons to create homemade lemonade), all of which he actively participated in, we were able to launch into success.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, I had totally forgotten what an incredible advocate #SyngapSiblings can be! This advocacy was essential in making plenty of sales and enticing customers to donate larger amounts ($20 per cup of lemonade, anyone)? We let Aayan do all of the talking while we withdrew to pouring the lemonade.</p><p>Aayan had a blast and felt empowered by doing something stereotypically more “adult.” He was even able to reach out to some of his classmates to donate money toward his cause.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"advocacy.png\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb56ac6a94ceb5ed7b28460_advocacy.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Unbeknownst to us at the time of the lemonade fundraiser, we realized afterwards that we now had a rather attractive platform from which to continue fundraising among our friends and family. <em>“Please Donate to Aayan’s </em><a href=\"https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/lemonade4syngap\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Lemonade Fundraiser</em></a><em>!”</em> sounded more appealing to people than having us (parents) reach out for donations. Consequently, while this project is current and incredibly needed to push us as a community closer toward a SynGAP treatment option. &nbsp;This project has been reviewed and endorsed by <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/sab\" target=\"_blank\">SRF SAB</a> and there is already a <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/hellergrant\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a> explaining it &amp; a <a href=\"https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/support-srf-epigenetics\" target=\"_blank\">fundraising page</a> set up.

Your child has a SYNGAP1 mutation. Speaking from my personal experience, you begin to spiral. &nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"ED653433-4DB1-44F6-AA61-211813F3C5E9.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb569f87a3d5631fe93a4fd_ED653433-4DB1-44F6-AA61-211813F3C5E9.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>I had been saying for months: “<em>I’m sure Kailyn has a rare genetic syndrome and we just don’t know it yet.</em>” A part of me was in denial which presented more like hope—thinking if we could just get her epilepsy under control, she’d begin to develop at a more typical rate and possibly even catch up to her peers. In reality there is no way a young child and developing brain could function or learn having upwards of 200 epileptic events daily. Then we got the call, and everything stopped. Several weeks after collecting samples for a full exome sequence, the neurologist called. I was on my way in to pick up Kai from her developmental preschool. </p><p>As I was trying to make sense of what the doctor was saying on the phone, I vividly remember being unable to process anything else that was going on around me. Again, I was already convinced her condition was genetic in nature, and it was only a matter of time until it was identified. Despite this, I was in a state of shock. It was a Friday and my husband Lj was out for a game of golf and an evening with friends. As so many of you know, It’s a rarity for either of us to slip away with two young kids, especially since one can have some pretty challenging behaviors. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"0E845255-7D91-438B-AC00-93E8EFB23547.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb569f9f215f269b86de868_0E845255-7D91-438B-AC00-93E8EFB23547.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>So, after putting the kids to bed, I was alone with my thoughts… and Google. I began to read all the published research that studied SYNGAP1 and SynGAP-related encephalopathy. I seesawed between reading Methods, Results, Discussions, and sobbing uncontrollably. Although my husband and I were aware that Kai was different and had challenges, this was the confirmation. I had to mourn what I thought life would look like for Kai and the changes that would mean for our lives as well. The grief of that weekend came in cycles. Thankful for my almost nauseatingly optimistic husband, I was (and am) wrapped in a blanket of comfort when needed. We put our heads and hearts together and did what we always do: face it head on.</p><p>Sometime in those first days after diagnosis, I took to social media for information and support as well. I joined every group with “Syngap” in the name on Facebook. I started getting friend requests and private messages from other parents of Syngapians. A few of those folks were Mike, Peter, and Virginie. Virginie offered to speak with me on the phone and I excitedly accepted the invitation. I think she and I spoke on the phone for nearly two hours. It was incredible to speak with a parent who had been in my shoes—having a fresh Syngap diagnosis. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"2904501A-61B7-47D1-9AB0-40E4459B1047.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb569f941739abc519de2f8_2904501A-61B7-47D1-9AB0-40E4459B1047.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>It was fascinating to compare notes on our kiddos’ symptoms and realize the shocking similarities. I felt right at home. And…cue relief: relief that we knew where to place Kai’s collection of symptoms; relief that we had support from families experiencing so many of the same challenges. </p><p>Fast forward a few months. The COVID pandemic is upon us. Day in and day out, we are caring for a special needs child, trying to work, trying to fulfill school requirements remotely, trying to facilitate tele-therapy appointments, and maintain our sanity. I think we can all relate. &nbsp;As Richard Engel <a href=\"https://www.today.com/parents/richard-engel-kids-special-needs-are-not-ok-right-now-t188987\">observed this week</a> “Having a special needs child was difficult before COVID. Now it’s dangerous for the children and for the mental health of the parents.” &nbsp;He’s right.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"6D52CC00-E913-466C-AF93-D4BF63893452.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb569f92e87c160ad6910e6_6D52CC00-E913-466C-AF93-D4BF63893452.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Late one night, I start to think about my mortality, and then it hit me. <em>We have this kid that will have lifelong needs. We need to plan for her: financially, medically, and for around the clock care in our absence.</em> Again, I turned to my trusty friend, Google. I began to research long-term planning for a special needs child. &nbsp;My research got me thinking, I wish there was a roadmap that would give some kind of to-do list and timeline for addressing these needs. &nbsp;What can or should I do now (or when) to accommodate Kai’s needs over the span of her life? My thoughts continued and I questioned, how can I ensure she’s taken care of, regardless of circumstance? Through this, I decided that as a community we need to compile and share resources so that newly diagnosed parents won’t experience the same online rabbit hole that I did. Reminder: Googling a stressful topic at night is never a good idea; especially when you have a SynGAPian that suffers with sleep dysfunction and will be up at the crack of dawn. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"2C4353AA-1E91-4C39-9886-56AD5033D073.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb569f97f7f1c825e0cfb81_2C4353AA-1E91-4C39-9886-56AD5033D073.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Perhaps your baby or toddler is newly diagnosed, and long-term planning has yet to even cross your mind.

    "Post Body": "<p><em>Kali Worth is a Director of the SynGAP Research Fund.</em></p><p><em>Disclaimer: Any blogs on long term planning are not to be construed as legal, financial, or medical advice. These writings are parents sharing personal experiences as well as sharing resources they have found helpful in order to make the daunting tasks of long-term planning with a rare kiddo a bit more manageable. Laws vary state-by-state. We suggest that you take what you learn from the blogs and webinars and seek the advice of lawyers, financial planners and other professionals that have expertise in working with special needs families in your area. </em><br> <br>You have searched, maybe for years, for answers to what is going on with your child. Your child (and as a result, your family) face significant daily challenges due to their condition. Once you receive the Syngap diagnosis, there is a steep learning curve. After all, the scientists are still learning about the gene and the phenotypes (symptoms) that result from the mutations that our children have. On top of learning about your child’s disease and advocating for him or her, those daily challenges don’t disappear with a diagnosis. In fact, they change and morph as our children miss more developmental milestones, struggle with uncontrolled epilepsy and face the numerous other medical, physical, intellectual, and behavioral challenges that come with having a SYNGAP1 variant. In fact, as a community, we have learned that Syngap symptoms do in fact continue to evolve as Syngap children become older. &nbsp;Our children will become adults, indeed a few have been diagnosed in the past couple of years, including one who is 65.<br> <br>So, the next piece in the jigsaw of having a rare kid? &nbsp;Long-term planning. Where does one even start? There are a lot of tough questions to be asked and answered when it comes to planning for the longevity of our children’s lives:&nbsp;<br></p><ul><li>Do only those with significant wealth need to set up wills, trusts, and other legally binding documents related to the distribution of finances?</li><li>What are the options to compile funds securely for my Syngap child?&nbsp;</li><li>What are the necessary steps to take to establish guardianship/conservatorship and how should I prepare?</li><li>How do I ensure my child is cared for in the way that I intend, in my absence?&nbsp;</li><li>What are the living options for my dependent adult child if I die or I am no longer able to care for them?&nbsp;</li></ul><p>All of us face mortality as part of the human condition. Long term planning is something that is a common discussion amongst families. However, our situation of planning for a Syngap child that will likely need ongoing care around the clock presents a unique and more urgent set of circumstances.</p><p>Their needs will continue to be vastly different than our children that grow up and become independently functioning adults. Even if your child is three, five, or ten years old, there are important issues to consider. Will your child age out of a state Medicaid waiver program? Would your child lose any current or future benefits needed to maintain their quality of life if they inherit even a small gift from well-meaning grandparents or other family members? Do you have all the information regarding your complex child’s current plan of care, medications, care team contact information, likes and dislikes in one place and stated succinctly? Or, like most of us busy special needs parents, is it all kept in a combination of your brain, your phone, and many, possibly scattered post-it notes?</p><p>Along the way of our topical blogs and webinar series, we intend to begin to answer these big questions and dig deeper into the finer details of planning for your Syngap child throughout their lifespan while more deeply explaining the rationale and importance of such long-term planning efforts. </p><p>Since we also recognize that there are numerous important topics to cover, we have decided to turn this set of blog articles into a Long-Term Planning Series during which we will publish an article on one topic per month. Here is the list we have so far:<br></p><ul><li>Creating a Special Needs Trust (SNT)</li><li>Drafting a Letter of Intent (LoI)</li><li>Setting up an ABLE account</li><li>Guardianship</li><li>Adult Living Arrangements (At Home, Group living: state-funded and private, co-housing Community)<br></li></ul><p>Do you have a unique perspective or ideas to any one of the topics? Feel free to reach out to us - we are always looking for contributions from our community! We look forward to walking this journey together, to do best by our children, now and in the future. If you are a parent, we also have a private Syngap group to discuss these issues, you can join here.</p>",

    "Post Body": "<p>While 2020 has felt to many like the longest year in our collective memory, Syngap Research Fund (SRF) is proud to announce that we have made substantial progress in our mission to situate our community closer to potential treatment options for our loved ones with SYNGAP1. The medical and scientific landscape focused on propelling SYNGAP1 research is ever growing as our patient population worldwide has approached <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/4q20\" target=\"_blank\">705</a> in total by the end of 2020. Consequently, SRF’s strategic vision and objectives are coming into view as we plan for the near future and for all of the work that remains to be done.<strong>‍</strong></p><h4><strong>Recap of key milestones and accomplishments at year end 2020</strong><br></h4><ul><li><strong>Funding science.</strong> To date, SRF has committed over $1.2M to labs at <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/new-grant-alert-epigenetics-is-part-of-the-syngap1-puzzle-we-can-solve-it\">UPenn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/srfcoba-why-we-need-a-srf-fellow-in-the-coba-lab-at-usc-focusing-on-syngap1\">USC</a>, Baylor, <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/syngap-researcher-spotlight-dr-gavin-rumbaugh-scripps-research-institute\">Scripps </a>&amp; <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/syngap-researcher-spotlight-dr-richard-huganir-johns-hopkins-university-school-of-medicine\">Hopkins</a>.&nbsp; Notably, the UPenn &amp; USC grants are to researchers who were not previously focusing on SynGAP.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Gathering data.</strong> SRF has launched a digital natural history study that allows a patient’s full medical history to be gathered and distilled into data that is freely available for researchers. In partnership with a remarkable company called <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/ciitizen-a-major-service\">Ciitizen</a>, we have already enrolled 90 patients and are <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/oneyearsooner\"><strong>continuing to invite</strong></a> the US community.</li><li><strong>Engaging families.</strong> Four groups of dedicated parents help SRF help people with SynGAP: a <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/home/our-team/meet-the-team-board-of-directors\">board of directors</a> (all parents), a committee of parent-scientists, <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/home/our-team/team-srf-patient-support-team\">a team of ambassadors</a> who support newly-diagnosed patients, and finally - a group of general volunteers.

    "Post Body": "<p>‍<em>Barbara is a retired technical professional. Her interests are painting, the arts, gardening, and, most of all, her family. She has three grown children and has four grandchildren (Syngapian </em><a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/syngap-warrior/naya\"><em>Naya</em></a><em>&nbsp; and her siblings.)</em><br><br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/608c2251478d1ec65311c0c8_818Ew-IljCtiEA_AWBqI-gyy3poh8WiMv-Lm-kOiBa6LzXmpYhyS87kL6FrYMFWuDkx1VVS-GFTiN-4Ud64tsv62V2v6uNV_OmgC3a-nXhsSUw0RNziyTN7PcDHpXuvR689SOzr6.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2><strong>What does it mean to love a Syngapian?</strong> </h2><p>There are so many ways to love. Parents (and sometimes others) take care of people with this rare disease. The caregivers seem to be gifted with faith and love to deal with this challenging life. But as a grandmother, I found myself questioning my role in our Syngapian’s life, not to mention in her mother’s — my own “little girl.” Would my granddaughter’s diagnosis change my relationship with my daughter? Before <a href=\"https://www.invitae.com/en/stories/naya-edouard/\">the Syngap1 diagnosis</a>, my beautiful 3-year-old granddaughter (now 4) had missed many milestones and we knew her behavior didn’t seem “normal.” For me, the diagnosis felt like a rock hit my heart, but this was a reality to be accepted with as much grace as I could summon. At this point, I began wondering what other Syngapian grandparents were experiencing, and through the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SyngapResearchFund\">SRF community</a> I became connected with six other families who were open to sharing their own experiences with me. I found both a commonality patterned around a shared diagnosis and its intrinsic issues and, simultaneously, other aspects of our experiences that were as unique as our grandchildren.<br></p><h2><strong>The response varies with the age at diagnosis&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>All of the families I spoke to have Syngapians, ranging from 3 to 19 years old. There are Syngapians who, through our advancing knowledge of genetics, are <a href=\"http://syngap.fund/caren\">diagnosed as adults</a>. The grandparents in cases where SYNGAP1 is diagnosed at an older age experience a certain level of relief from the news. They have lived with the symptoms of the disease for many years, and finally understanding the cause is a comfort. These parents view the documented symptoms as a biographical story, one they have lived. By contrast, grandparents of children diagnosed in the infant/toddler years experience a more immediate sense of grief and loss. They were aware of and accepted developmental delays, but the diagnosis dashes one particular hope: that this is something their grandchildren will outgrow.<br></p><h2><strong>Distance is a challenge</strong></h2><p>Geographical togetherness or separation also varies between the families. Some grandparents live in close proximity and can be more involved. The fortunate families with nearby grandparents have extra sets of hands to share the countless surprises each day brings and, often, the grands enjoy some special times while giving parents a needed break. Other grandparents must find creative ways to love from afar.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Most families felt the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. There was less ability to be physically together and to help in concrete ways to offset daily stresses. Parents’ burdens also increased with the additional needs of siblings with remote schooling requirements and the additional needs of these siblings who lacked the stimulation and interaction with outside friends and family members. Remote grandparenting is an obstacle because our visits do not take place at frequent intervals. It’s simpler to establish close relationships with neurotypical grandchildren because they both understand and communicate using basic language skills. With them, grandparents can communicate using the telephone, email or text. With children, like our Naya, video conferencing tools, e.g., FaceTime and Zoom, are helpful in keeping grandparents’ faces familiar.<br></p><h2><strong>What’s a grandparent to do?</strong></h2><p>Managing seizures and medications, oral dyspraxia (feeding difficulties), hypotonia (muscle weakness), physical aggression, erratic sleeping schedules and alternative means of communication are routine to parents. Those not accustomed to meeting these needs are less at ease and, perhaps, reticent to care for their grandchildren. Physical care is needed to keep both adult(s) and children safe, but emotional support--understanding--is just as meaningful.&nbsp;</p><p><em>We can’t allow symptoms to create a chasm in the closeness we long for.&nbsp;<br></em></p><p>Again, grandparents who live nearby and visit frequently, gain more confidence in handling these emergent situations. Some take the symptoms in stride, but for others there is confusion and uncertainty. How can grandparents learn the skills to help? We must proceed at our own pace and be patient with ourselves as we traverse this new terrain. Like other life lessons, this takes time.<br></p><h2><strong>Siblings are a wonderful avenue for support</strong></h2><p>Supporting neurotypical siblings is a powerful way for grandparents to help parents who are focusing on a child with SYNGAP1. While we sometimes feel helpless with respect to the special needs of our Syngapians, their siblings are a vehicle for support. The grandparents I spoke to expressed so much pride when describing all of their grandchildren. As for myself, I’m so pleased to have grandchildren who honor and abide Naya through both her good and bad days. My daughter and son-in-law seem to have boundless energy for their family, but I know there are limits. As geographically distant grandparents, we’ve enjoyed success supporting the neurotypical siblings with their schoolwork, for example, when the siblings write about specific subjects they enjoy. We’ve covered subjects such as favorite animals, baking cakes, taking photographs and reporting on books they have read. When acting as their “virtual” writing teacher, we become closer by learning more about each other. My daughter has shared that she’s relieved there is someone in their lives who can pay individual attention to them, since Naya’s needs sometimes have to take preference in daily routines.&nbsp;<br></p><h2><strong>We never stop worrying about our kids</strong></h2><p>Common to all grandparents is concern for their adult children. The parents of Syngapians are, of course, sons and daughters, themselves. Grandparents are concerned about the extra stressors put on these families because special needs children require so much unique care. It’s more difficult to keep them safe. The many therapies they require put a strain on time and budgets. Coordinating clinical care and organizing finances requires hours of paperwork. There’s concern for siblings and for mother/father relationships. The activities of life are much more complex when dealing with special needs children. A subject of concern that deserves its own article is guardianship. Smaller families are especially concerned around this sensitive topic.<br></p><h2><strong>Hidden joys are found when we interact</strong></h2><p>Finally, what’s most important is the commitment both these grandparents and their children (parents) have to their sweet Syngapians. We all enjoy watching the breakthroughs and triumphs when our loved ones do well. We are “all in” for doing whatever we can. Each grandparent is interested in strengthening their relationships with their special grandchildren, despite the challenges. We are willing to learn about safety measures, mental stimulation and enrichment and helping our loved ones feel both secure and comfortable in our presence.&nbsp;</p><p>The exuberant laughter of a Syngapian enjoying the simple pleasures of clapping hands, enjoying a favorite food, or rides in elevators spreads a warm glow to us all. One of my favorite stories is about the little one who uses the Greek word for Grandma, “YaYa.” We can brag that our grandchildren are multilingual, and they are! These are the rewards we receive as we search for ways to show love to our children and grandchildren.</p><h2><strong>We all do what we can</strong></h2><p>Some grandparents have supported SYNGAP research through donations to SRF and in-home fundraisers. Others are learning as much as they can via SRF’s <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/families/support/syngap-warriors\">Wednesday Warriors</a> and <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/families/resources/webinars\">Webinars</a>. One thing I am doing is opening this conversation.<br></p><p>In closing, I want to acknowledge all of the participants for sharing their stories. I also want to encourage other grandparents to speak. Reaching out and talking to each other helps put our challenges in perspective. Hopefully this brief article will be only the beginning of a journey we can take together.<br></p><p><em>How can we support each other?

Rather than succumbing to despair and accepting a bleak future for their sons and daughters, these moms and dads took matters into their own hands and ignited a global movement to unite the SynGAP community, raise awareness, improve access to support and resources, and fund and propel research. Our village is stronger thanks to each and every one of these individuals, and we are grateful for their continued commitment to our kids and dedicated collaboration with one another.</p><p>These are not all of the global #SyngapLeaders — there are more in Europe, Asia and Latin America that we will profile in an upcoming article — but this is the core team that collaborates night and day on Slack and other platforms to help Syngapians everywhere.</p><h3><br></h3><h2><strong>SOLENNE LAFEYTAUD DIAGNOSED 2011— PRESIDENT &amp; FOUNDER OF OVERCOME SYNGAP1 IN CANADA 🇨🇦 &amp; FRANCE 🇫🇷</strong></h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:331px\"><div><img alt=\"GlobalVillage2.png\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7af59af328672c1a076fc_GlobalVillage2.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Solenne and her husband, who are French, moved to Canada in 2006 with their two daughters, ages five and two.

Aaron worked as a clinical laboratory scientist at the military hospital while Monica was a stay-at-home mom after the birth of their son <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bss_44qAnFx/\" target=\"_blank\">Jaxon</a>. At first, she enjoyed walks in the neighborhood and time with other families while caring for her youngest child. It wasn’t until Jaxon’s nine-month well-baby check that life took a radical turn for the Harding family.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft\"><div><img alt=\"Monica &amp; Aaron at Global Genes 2019, advocating tirelessly for Syngap as they have done for years.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7af59ed1767420c13af47_image-asset.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Monica &amp; Aaron at Global Genes 2019, advocating tirelessly for Syngap as they have done for years.</figcaption></figure><p>Aaron recalls that in 2007 Jaxon’s developmental pediatrician wrote that one of the possible causes for his challenges could be genetic. Because they were seeking ABA services for their son’s autism diagnosis, Aaron and Monica were worried that further testing results could disqualify them for services and decided not to pursue further testing in 2008.</p><p>Though his symptoms appeared at a young age it wasn’t until December 2014, when Jaxon was eleven years old, that he would be diagnosed with SynGAP. Plenty of routine testing for Fragile X, mitochondrial disorder, etc. had been performed, but it was only Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) became available that the SynGAP mutation was found.</p><p>Currently, Aaron is the Deputy Managing Director for <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SynGAP Research Fund</a> (SRF), advising on all things SynGAP and focusing on developing collaborating relationships with other patient groups (e.g., LGS and Dravet), autism and epilepsy organizations, as well as biotechnology companies. All of these relationships directly benefit the SynGAP patient community. Previously, he served in several leadership roles with another US foundation for over three years, including as Co-PI of the NORD/FDA data registry before resigning in August 2018.</p><p>Aaron knows what needs to be done to move toward a cure for patients with this rare disease. “<em>There needs to be an urgency to fund research &amp; fill the gaps that federal grants won’t. What is necessary, is to make SynGAP attractive in a competitive rare disease biotech market. Because the co-founders of SRF, Ashley and Mike , have personally invested into a cure, you can be assured that all fundraising goes directly to research — guaranteed! We must form a unified global community — SynGAP ONE!</em>”</p><h2><strong>DANIELLE WILLIAMS DIAGNOSED 2016 — FOUNDER OF </strong><a href=\"http://www.supportepilepsy.com.au/event/SynGAPresearch\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>SYNGAP RESEARCH</strong></a><strong> IN AUSTRALIA 🇦🇺</strong></h2><p>Before their daughters were born, Danielle was running marathons and her husband Danny was lecturing all over Europe as an osteopath, working in an obstetric hospital and in clinic. They were living in London at the time, but moved to Melbourne, Australia when Jaeli, their eldest, was one. Danielle had also worked in the disease prevention industry for over 20 years, focused on motivating populations to change their behavior around modifiable risk factors like physical inactivity.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft\"><div><img alt=\"Dani, Danny, Jaeli &amp; Dali\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7af5a17b6b420f7880a3a_GlobalVillage5.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Dani, Danny, Jaeli &amp; Dali</figcaption></figure><p>After five years of searching for the ‘why,’ <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BuHIVG1B4or/\" target=\"_blank\">Jaeli</a> (9) and Dali (7) were diagnosed with SynGAP in February 2016. Since receiving the diagnosis, Danielle and Danny have advocated for whole genome sequencing in Australia, contributed to published SynGAP research (co-authoring the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/SRF_4PbyP_NeuroPaper\" target=\"_blank\">Neurology paper</a> on the largest SynGAP cohort), partnered with The Epilepsy Foundation to create SynGAP Research Australia, launched the #secret4syngap fundraising campaign raising SynGAP awareness through media coverage, lobbied the Australian government for funding, and funded a dedicated SynGAP researcher for two years.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft\"><div><img alt=\"GlobalVillage6.png\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7af5959b3f3173b586419_GlobalVillage6.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>In February 2018, the Australian government announced AUD$2 million of funding for genetic epilepsy. The first funded project was for SynGAP research, of which $500k was awarded to the <a href=\"https://www.florey.edu.au/science-research/scientist-directory/professor-steven-petrou\" target=\"_blank\">Florey Institute</a>, who commenced work in November 2018. <a href=\"http://supportepilepsy.com.au/event/SynGAPresearch\" target=\"_blank\">Syngap Research</a> in Australia has consistently grown from the generosity of its community and Danielle and Danny look forward to committing these funds to continuing the Syngap research effort beyond 2020. They are dedicated to enabling researchers to crack the SynGAP code.</p><p>Even though rare disease can be isolating, Danielle and her husband are grateful to have found the opportunity to connect with their community, both local and global. They are most proud of co-founding <a href=\"https://www.syngapglobal.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Syngap Global Network</a> and locally the <a href=\"https://www.geneticepilepsyteam.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Genetic Epilepsy Team Australia (GETA)</a> with a mission to help world-leading researchers cure Genetic Epilepsy.</p><p>Danielle wants families to know we are the closest we’ve ever been to finding a cure for repairing the SynGAP dysfunction responsible for the challenges we see in our children. “<em>It’s especially comforting when you consider the advances in medical research over the last decade: Ten years ago only 5% of epilepsies had a known genetic explanation; now there are over 80 (more than 50%) due to the introduction of chromosomal microarray and next generation sequencing. Diagnosis is not the only research area benefitting from advances in technology. We are at the dawn of precision medicine. I do believe precision medicine will find a way to repair the production of SynGAP for our loved ones. Gene therapy has already provided viable therapeutic options for other conditions.</em>”</p><p>She also encourages parents to be prepared. “<em>We need to be ready to fast track those breakthroughs, so they convert into viable treatments for our kids as soon as possible. Researchers and biotechnology companies have advised us what we can do to fast track successful therapeutic approaches. We need to be investing our energy into participating in data registries like </em><a href=\"https://www.simonssearchlight.org/research/what-we-study/syngap1/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Simon’s Searchlight</em></a><em> as well as Natural History Studies which will fast track the regulatory approval of treatments when they arise.</em>”</p><h2><strong>VIRGINIE MCNAMAR DIAGNOSED 2016 — COFOUNDER OF THE SYNGAP GLOBAL NETWORK 🌍 AND PATIENT ENGAGEMENT LEAD FOR SRF IN USA 🇺🇸</strong></h2><p>Before her son <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtPwCHph0uJ/\" target=\"_blank\">Ty</a> was born, Virginie was working full time as a product director for a software company.

She herself suffers from a rare disease called erythopoetic protoporphyria (EPP), and her oldest child was diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome and a high IQ ten years ago.</p><p>In 2004, she co-founded a patient support group for EPP. For more than 10 years she was the Vice President of the German EPP Association and used her experiences in marketing and public relations to increase awareness for the disease and to foster patient relations.</p><p>In 2013, her second son <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B0BhIqJFJc3/\" target=\"_blank\">Jamie</a> was born. Now six, he was two and a half years old when he was diagnosed with SynGAP. Verena decided to advocate for rare disease and use her skills to work for the global SynGAP community. From the moment she was told about this genetic disorder, it was clear her mission was to find other affected families, learn as much as she could about the diagnosis and help improve the lives of the global SynGAP family.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:388px\"><div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7af5a32cba437c2713356_image-asset.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>In 2016 Verena and her family founded the German SynGAP Family Support Group, called “SYNGAP Elternhilfe.” Currently there are 34 patients in Germany, which makes the country the fourth biggest SynGAP population in the world.</p><p>Verena and her family are involved in numerous groups within the special needs community, including developmental delay and epilepsy, in order to form a network of parents watching out for potential and diagnosed SynGAP patients. Observing a significant lack of information about SynGAP within the special needs community, Verena set out to help families with kids affected by developmental delay — the first symptom shown by SynGAP patients — to take steps toward a diagnosis, starting a social media group to offer a platform for discussion. This strategy helped to set many potential SynGAP patients on the right track to genetic testing.</p><p>In 2017 Verena and her son motivated a group of German clinicians from Schön Klinik in Vogtareuth/Germany (one of the best epilepsy centers) to write about a unique symptom seen in many SynGAP patients: seizures triggered by eating. In 2019 <a href=\"https://www.seizure-journal.com/article/S1059-1311(18)30466-7/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">the scientific paper about SynGAP-related eating epilepsy was published</a>, and included data from Jamie and seven other patients from the global SynGAP family.</p><p>To further educate the public about SynGAP and to give insight into life with a child with disabilities, Verena writes a Facebook blog, called “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MinimannSyngapSyndrom/\" target=\"_blank\">Minimann’s Leben mit Syngap Syndrom</a>,” with over 2000 followers. There she gives a voice to her non-verbal son and tells the world about his adventures from his perspective.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft\"><div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7af5aa4834a1cb95f2a55_image-asset.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Verena wants SynGAP families to know they aren’t alone. “<em>If you want to learn from other families about this rare disease and connect with others in your area and globally, join our “</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/192235898087636/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>SYNGAP global family support” group</em></a><em>.

Rachel, who was ten at the time of diagnosis and who is now thirteen, was one of seventeen participants in a European-wide study several years earlier on intellectual disability and epilepsy. The study ultimately led to a published <a href=\"http://childhoodepilepsy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/syngap.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">research paper</a> by <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cyril_Mignot\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Mignot</a> and a confirmed SynGAP diagnosis for Rachel. This came as a surprise to the Laverrieres, as the blood sample used in the study had been drawn a few years prior in Lyon, France and they assumed that sample would not be used again.</p><p>To manage Rachel’s care, which includes a full schedule of medical appointments, Sébastien’s wife quit her job and became the primary caregiver. Sébastien credits her with being instrumental in keeping their family life stable and providing their children with the best childhood possible. The family moved from France to Switzerland eight years ago to ensure Rachel receives the best possible care, and Sébastien works full time in cybersecurity as a data protection specialist.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft\"><div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7af5a3347e771046fe6aa_image-asset.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Sébastien has been part of the <a href=\"https://www.syngapglobal.net/\" target=\"_blank\">SynGap Global Network</a> since its inception and is active in creating and overseeing SGN social medial content, including helpful infographics and videos.

SCHLECHT, MD</strong></a><strong> DIAGNOSED 2017— SCIENCE &amp; MEDICAL LEAD, </strong><a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>SYNGAP RESEARCH FUND</strong></a></h2><p>Hans is an infectious diseases physician who emphasizes outpatient care of patients with HIV as well as inpatient care of patients with all sorts of infections. He’s had an interest in translational research since his fellowship training in infectious diseases. His son <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt0u04Ohr3S/\" target=\"_blank\">Erich</a> was born in 2015 while he was working at Drexel University College of Medicine and Hahnemann University Hospital.</p><p>His one-year check-up was a little late, and by that time Erich’s pediatrician could tell something was wrong. Soon they were being referred to developmental pediatrics, neurology, and genetics. Then it was metabolomics and neurogenetics. It took 10 months from that screening to the whole exome sequencing results, with the SynGAP diagnosis, to come back in the first week of March 2017.</p><p>Erich is now four years old and his older sister Anneka is seven.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft\"><div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7af5aa4834a7bb25f2a56_image-asset.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Dr. Schlecht’s first efforts in SynGAP were for his son. He did a deep dive into his variant and reached out to others for help. The most immediate thing he could do to help him was find a nonsense read-through agent, so he reached out to PTC Therapeutics, the maker of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataluren\" target=\"_blank\">ataluren</a>, which is read-through agent that has some data in cystic fibrosis and Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy. Hans nagged the company for an IND to treat Erich, it was approved in November 2017 and Erich started the treatment in March of 2018 a few days after his third birthday.</p><p>While the family waited for ataluren approval, he broached the subject of trying azithromycin (the medication in a Z-pak) since there was some data of it promoting read-through. He felt these meds were safe and they were glad as parents to have the chance to try them. Unfortunately, it didn’t seem that medication either helped Erich, probably because his nonsense containing transcripts are getting chewed up by a process called nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Hans reached out to a scientist on how to block NMD in a SYNGAP-gene specific way but it does not suit Erich’s variant.</p><p>Dr. Schlecht continues to read Science and Nature trying to keep up with the latest progress in gene therapy and regularly shares articles of interest with others in the SRF. To be ready for gene therapy, he thinks it’s key to have a biomarker(s) that can promptly look at the levels of SYNGAP expression. Since too much SynGAP is toxic, the FDA will be wary to allow gene therapy without some monitoring of SynGAP. He would love to have a blood test for SynGAP but even though we aren’t there yet, he believes we will be.</p><p>Dr. Schlecht has also spoken at two <a href=\"https://globalgenes.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Genes</a> conferences on his efforts for Erich so people who aren’t doctors with backgrounds in research can hopefully see a path or technique that may work for them. Because of the talks he’s heard at these conferences, he’s come up with an idea to use the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee number in ICD-10 and ICD-11 so that any pathogenic gene variant could be a part of the medical record as an ICD diagnosis. He spearheaded the submission by a group of 12 rare disease organizations to the CDC for ICD-10 codes and proposed the idea in the WHO’s ICD-11 Maintenance platform.</p><p>Lastly, he signed Erich up to be an <a href=\"https://medium.com/@syngapfund/have-you-donated-your-kids-brain-yet-f97a43cf4e5a\" target=\"_blank\">NIH brain donor</a> so science can learn whatever it can from him after his passing. It’s difficult to do this for your own child, but the power of autopsy studies can’t be underestimated.</p><p>Dr. Schlecht’s message to families is to focus on action. “<em>Do what you can. For me it’s being a Science pest. Maybe you can fundraise for SRF. Build a website. Form a SYNGAP group. Keep a blog with tips for new parents. Listen to other folks asking for help and step up in the way you can.</em>”</p><h2><strong>AMIT MANDORA DIAGNOSED 2018 — FOUNDER OF </strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/syngap1india/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>SYNGAP1 INDIA</strong></a></h2><p>Amit Mandora and his wife were both working before their son <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bu85HBNF9oC/\" target=\"_blank\">Vivaan</a> was born.

    "Post Body": "<p> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-duggan-15b94145/\"><em>Jessica Duggan</em></a><em> is from Luton, Bedfordshire, UK, currently living in New York City, and mum to </em><a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/syngap-warrior/hannah\"><em>Hannah</em></a><em>, she is the SRF NY area Patient Ambassador.&nbsp;</em><br></p><p><em>Caroline Bilal is the mother of Yonas, an 8 year old SynGAPian, and supporter of the SRF blog and parent stories.</em><br><br></p><p><strong>Caroline: </strong>Tell us a bit about how you got involved in the making of this movie?<br></p><p><strong>Jess:</strong> When your child is diagnosed with a rare disease, for the next 24-48 hours you kind of live their whole life, fast-forwarded, entirely in your own head. The day my daughter was diagnosed her doctor emailed me a journal article. It contained a two line description of a patient with a similar disease presentation as my daughter’s. This patient had been diagnosed as an adult, by chance, because of his daughter’s significant developmental delays. The article simply said: “dropped out of school, suffers from depression, lives on disability aid”. Is that my daughter’s future? Is that the best I can hope for? Is that the <em>worst</em> I can hope for?</p><p>Since then I’ve often wondered about the adults with my daughter’s disease: <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/families/support/welcome-pack\">SYNGAP1</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Since SYNGAP1 patients are almost always random <em>de novo </em>genetic mutations, meaning, this mutation happens by chance or at random, then statistically there are almost as many adults out there as children. But where are they? Who are they? How are they faring? What can they and their loved ones&nbsp; teach us about how to best care for our children? How can we help them and their families? Unfortunately, until genetic testing for adults with developmental disabilities and epilepsy becomes the standard, we will only find them by chance.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>This is also what happened to Caren. At the age of 64, Caren underwent genetic testing for reasons unrelated to her SYNGAP1 symptoms and was finally given a formal diagnosis after her family’s long search for answers. With that diagnosis, Caren is the oldest diagnosed person we’re aware of with SYNGAP1 and instantly became a celebrity within our community. Many parents believe that Caren’s experiences shed light onto our own children’s future. Our community’s fascination with Caren, her family and her life lead to an outpouring of support for the development of a documentary and I was lucky enough to be asked to join Caren and her family as the voice of the <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/\">Syngap Research Fund</a> in the movie.&nbsp;<br></p><p>While I was excited and honored to be asked to participate, deep down I was also nervous to meet Caren.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Weeks later I found myself on the train to New Jersey, from New York City’s Penn Station. I was headed to the film set of <a href=\"https://informaconnect.com/rare-disease-film-festival/speakers/daniel-defabio/\">Daniel Defabio</a> and his crew who were going to direct Caren’s movie. I had a lot of mixed feelings. Was I going to be able to hold it together meeting Caren, her sister and guardian, Nancy, and Daniel the director - who himself had just lost his son not too long ago to a different rare disease? My worries were exacerbated by my concerns that I could somehow infect the crew or anyone on the set with COVID-19 (without even knowing it!). After all, Caren had just recovered from some of the most adverse effects of the virus.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>C: </strong>Where was the movie filmed?<br></p><p><strong>J:</strong> We all met at Caren’s group home in New Jersey and most of the film footage was captured outdoors in her garden on what ended up being a lovely Fall day. Nancy and Daniel’s incredibly welcoming and warm demeanor immediately put at ease any worries that I had. Nancy was just as wonderful as she had seemed on the phone. The group home was beautiful - not at all like what I had imagined. I had&nbsp; an outdated idea of what these group homes might look like and I was surprised to be proven wrong. You wouldn't think it's a group home except there was a people carrier parked in the driveway. Just a regular suburban ranch/bungalow adapted for the residents’ needs. Caren has her own area of the house with 24/7 care, all her therapies are provided at-home, there's lovely landscaping and a beautiful peaceful garden for the residents to enjoy.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/602b0f6ff048e1519dc943d1_caren.png\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>C: </strong>Were you nervous at all to be on film?<br></p><p><strong>J:</strong> I wasn't nervous about being on film, though, what posed to be a bit of challenge was my goal of answering the interview questions in a way that would make sense for existing diagnosed families, newly diagnosed families, undiagnosed families, and people new to SYNGAP1 so they would understand our kids’ challenges. After being immersed in SYNGAP1 for a while, I felt it was hard to pull myself back into what it was like \"before\" knowing much about it. In my head and when I found myself responding to some of Daniel’s questions, I was imagining a newly diagnosed family watching this film after receiving the news and so I wanted to speak directly to them, while also speaking to the physicians who may not have been convinced of the value for adults to have their DNA sequenced<br></p><p>You don't see this in the film but I was speaking directly to Daniel during most of the film when you see me speaking. Daniel had recently lost his son Lucas to a neurodegenerative disease called Menkes. It was tough for me to talk about how terrible living with a broken copy of SYNGAP1 can be, with childhood&nbsp; epilepsy, the development of self-injurious and aggressive behaviors,&nbsp; cognitive and medical challenges.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And here we have Caren who has survived to be 64 years of age, while my daughter has a milder presentation (she can walk and talk). So a little bit of imposter syndrome, if that makes sense. I often think of SYNGAP1 as an imposter syndrome to some extent,&nbsp; as I see our community fighting to get SYNGAP1 noticed by the research and pharma community against all these other neurodegenerative diseases where kids are dying. I get this feeling of... well perhaps these other diseases should be addressed first. On the other hand, I see how members (especially caregivers) in our community struggle through the management of SYNGAP1 - parents being forced to leave their jobs to pursue child-advocacy full time, endless fight with insurance to cover necessary treatments (some even ending up in bankruptcy), growing tensions between parents (some ending in divorce) as families are sometimes forced to put their whole lives on hold to deal with the negative side-effects of this developmental disability. It certainly isn’t easy!<br></p><p>That said, Nancy, Caren’s sister, was keen to focus on the positive parts of Caren's story, and of course, as SYNGAP1 is a devastating disease, we needed to explain that very carefully. As with explaining a lot of the aspects of SYNGAP,&nbsp; we are dealing with very complex topics that have to be simplified just enough and accurately enough to make it accessible to patients and their families, which is not an easy task.</p><p><br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyLfV1BH1XI\" target=\"_blank\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/602b0d263b11292a9fffe944_IqdXYK1Tn2NnlMInw6aclKXgVS0qXDUfMuG7Ga3F6O0jSGrxPbeL9nAHaxXel0RpCpmXRPquAQWmVsU3QHcaiOIgHbw_k5qdGg0RRfBRI5sDjbEgVzQmDVwvlnC1gvPSH1h6fygI.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></a></figure><p><strong>C: </strong>What was most memorable to you about the filming itself?<br></p><p><strong>J: </strong>During filming, I was worried Caren was in the sun too long or that we were bothering her with all the filming. It was fascinating having the chance to chat with Caren directly and asking her questions. She didn’t reply much that day but gave me soul piercing looks and smiles. I remember thinking Caren was able to call Nancy by her name when she wanted her attention, something my Hannah can't do.&nbsp; I also really wished there was something I could do to help Caren colour with crayons. She was really trying hard but her fine motor skills have deteriorated over the years.<br></p><p>Another memorable part of the day included conversations I got to have with Nancy after and in between takes. Learning additional details and facts about Caren’s life was fascinating.&nbsp; When Nancy told me about Caren's lobotomy I couldn't stop thinking about it and thinking about SYNGAP1 kids in the past and how they were treated. I <em>still </em>can't stop thinking about this. I also couldn’t help but deeply sympathize with Caren and Nancy’s parents and wishing I could have met them. I couldn’t help but think about how they must have felt going through this process alone, without the help of the internet, simply trying to make the best possible choices with the information they had and without the support of the laws that protect and support disabled people today.&nbsp;<br>‍</p><p><strong>C: </strong>Anything else you want to share about the experience?</p><p><strong>J: </strong>&nbsp;It was lovely. Our children although alike in many ways, are all on their own paths. But the more patients we know, the better we will understand this disease in its entirety. Perhaps more importantly, it will drive us toward finding ways of mitigating the difficult, painful, debilitating aspects of this disease. Furthermore, it will allow us to better understand and support our children and the adults they will become. So many of the SYNGAP1 parents who know about Caren are eager to hear her story and learn about her life.&nbsp; It is definitely a story worth telling and all of us are eager to see Caren’s story come to life in the very first screening on February 26th.

    "Post Body": "<h3><strong>FORWARD</strong></h3><p>I’ve read this story many times. &nbsp;Each time a different part stops me. &nbsp;Cold. &nbsp;When I spoke to Ayrana, I was awestruck by what she has been through, grateful that she is willing to share, humbled by her grace, and brokenhearted by her suffering. &nbsp;My analytical mind sought to analyze what went wrong, but the truth is that there is no one answer. &nbsp;It is a cacophony of errors. &nbsp;Mistakes made by numerous individuals in our medical &amp; educational systems that do not have the experience or perspective to serve rare--medically complex--patients. &nbsp;The point of sharing this story is not to blame anyone, but to provide this perspective so that families, clinicians, and educators can prevent it from continuing to happen.</p><p>There are at least five stories here, packed into the first 15 years of one hard life and the lives of those who care for her.</p><ul><li>First, the story of a mom raising a SynGAPian. &nbsp;</li><li>Second, the story of a misdiagnosis combined with medicines given to prevent symptoms from a disease she did not have, causing challenges that were very real.</li><li>Third, a young special needs woman being given a birth control option that turned her hormones and world upside down.</li><li>Fourth, a patient being given Benzodiazepine, repeatedly, by a system that refused to believe her mother when she said they had the opposite of their intended effects.</li><li>Fifth, a child with neurological issues who was re-traumatized by her school system, hospital system and law enforcement to the point that, but for her mother’s dedication and commitment, she would already have been placed in a psychiatric home.</li></ul><p>This story is not easy to read. &nbsp;It is not a tale of triumph so much as a testament of survival -- but the line is blurry. &nbsp;It is also not over, but very much in progress: Melissa will turn 15 later this year. &nbsp;</p><p>Read it. A few times. Then give it to your doctors, teachers, researchers, and family. &nbsp;Share it out. &nbsp;We have to do better, and that won't happen until we look clear-eyed at what a mess our families face today.</p><p>If there is one message for parents to take away from this story, it is this quote from mom: “Some drugs have the opposite effect, some drugs barely affect her, and some she is really sensitive to… but the doctors don’t always listen.” &nbsp;It is true, our medically complex kids have sometimes peculiar reactions with many drugs. &nbsp;If you feel like your doctor isn’t listening to you, find one that does. &nbsp;(If they are, thank them.)</p><p>-<a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/team-profiles/mike-graglia\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mike</em></a></p><p><em>Ayrana Frazier is from Brazil, and came to the US when she was 16. &nbsp;She lives in New Jersey with her mother, Melissa, 4 cats and 2 dogs. &nbsp;She has a Masters degree in Criminology and is currently an employee of the Department of Homeland Security.</em></p><h1><em>Melissa's Story</em></h1><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"IMG_1652.PNG\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb567ed25129df54cddcb2b_IMG_1652.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3><strong>MY LITTLE GIRL: AGE 0-3</strong></h3><p>Let me start by saying this: as dark as it sounds, for the past 12 years, I have cried and prayed every day that Melissa goes a day before I do because I cannot fathom what will happen to her when I am no longer here. I do not know if that will happen. As long as I am here, I continue to work as hard as I can to ensure that she can be as independent as possible for the day when I am no longer here with her. &nbsp;I don't want to fail her as a parent. I cannot imagine my little girl suffering more than she has already.</p><p>Almost 15 years ago, my Melissa was born via scheduled C-section. She was born at full term and weighed almost 9 lbs. She passed all her newborn tests with flying colors before leaving the hospital. Melissa hit all of her baby milestones until 9 months old, then she stagnated. She was not making attempts to walk and she was not saying \"mama\" or \"dada\". Eventually, Melissa began walking at 18 months old, but she was still not talking. Her pediatrician insisted that everything was fine; that she was on pace with all of the other milestones, and all kids develop differently. They commented that bilingual children start talking later than monolingual children, as an explanation for her speech delay.</p><p>Our pediatrician became concerned when Melissa was 34 months. She advised that Melissa receive Early Intervention for the two months left before her 3rd birthday. Besides her delayed speech and her occasional hand tremor, there was no hint that my child had any other issues. Melissa was like a typical child—she was lovable and friendly, she would play, follow commands, make great eye contact. I was naïve. I believed, I hoped that everything was great. Or, perhaps at the time, I did not want to label my child. I could not yet consider she had a disability, so I carried on until I could not deny it any more.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"IMG_1730.PNG\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb567eddbfc19a939d93472_IMG_1730.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3><strong>EPILEPSY ONSET: AGE 3</strong></h3><p>Melissa was 3 when, as I was getting her out of the car, I saw her eyes begin to flicker. When I said her name, she didn't answer me. It took three times before I took her to the ER. This was the beginning of my world being turned upside down by Epilepsy.</p><p>After a few hours and many tests, I learned that these episodes were seizures. I had always been under the impression that seizures were convulsions—I never realized that there were so many different seizure types. She also had a 1 cm benign cyst on the right temporal lobe. We stayed in the hospital for about 5 days to ensure seizures were controlled before discharge.</p><p>After being discharged, we had a follow-up visit with a neurologist. Melissa was prescribed <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1788/depakote-oral/details\" target=\"_blank\">Depakote</a> and <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-8486-7217/lamictal-oral/lamotrigine-oral/details\" target=\"_blank\">Lamictal</a>, both first-line anti-epileptic drugs. After a week of taking both medications, Melissa developed rashes all over her body and began vomiting, known side effects from Lamictal. The doctors replaced Lamictal with &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-14494-6019/topamax-oral/topiramate-oral/details\" target=\"_blank\">Topamax</a>. &nbsp;A <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4110841/#:~:text=An%20open%20study%20examined%20the,about%2020%25%20at%2012%20months.\" target=\"_blank\">side effect of Topamax is cognitive delay</a>, but nobody told me this until she was 10 (7 years later).</p><p>For the next 6 years, we had to see a neurologist every 3 months, do blood work and have an EEG every 6 months, VEEG (Video EEG) annually, as well as MRIs every 2 years. Four different neurologists tried to pinpoint what she had, but they could not identify the cause or triggers of the seizures. They could not identify an underlying disorder. &nbsp;All they knew was she was somewhat delayed. At one point, they even suggested that maybe I dropped her when she was little and was not being truthful. &nbsp; When the doctors could not figure it out, they blamed me. I felt horrible.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"2010 5 years old .PNG\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb567ed3fc58849aa2475db_2010%2B5%2Byears%2Bold%2B.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3><strong>FROM SPECIAL ED TO A SPECIALIZED SCHOOL: AGE 6-9</strong></h3><p>Melissa started school in a modified program that was 50% special education and 50% general education. We were hopeful she would catch up with these accommodations.</p><p>When Melissa was 6, her doctor gave her a diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) so she could receive services. At this time, Melissa was not talking or making developmental progress. She was learning at her own pace, but this pace was extremely slow. She knew her ABCs, simple math, and could write her name. She could understand words in English, Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian. &nbsp;By third grade, Melissa's speech had improved a little. She could say a few words, but she was still not using sentences.</p><p>Melissa had always loved school, but halfway through in 4th grade, at age 10 I noticed that she started to seem somewhat reluctant to go to school. One afternoon, I received a call from her school. I was shocked to learn that Melissa was having a full-blown meltdown. When I arrived to pick her up, I was even more shocked to learn that she had been restrained by untrained personnel for about 3 hours. My child had bruises all over her body. Child Protective Services dismissed my case because I did not take her to the ER to get checked out. </p><p>She had lasting marks on her skin from the time she was forcibly restrained and I now had marks on my heart from what happened to her. These marks instilled so many emotions in Melissa and me: pain, sadness, fear, anger. I knew I had to act for her, but it would take time for me to realize the full scope of these marks on Melissa.</p><p>After this episode, I successfully advocated to have Melissa moved out of district school and have her placed in a specialized school. I believed that was the appropriate place for her. Things were good, until they were not. It would take time, but I would learn no school would be appropriate for Melissa.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"2011+6+years+old+.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb567edb77d2f499a517744_2011%252B6%252Byears%252Bold%252B.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3><strong>A CLOUD LIFTS: AGE 10</strong></h3><p>At age 10, Melissa started having more challenges. She started refusing to eat and she would throw up every time we attempted to feed her. Sleep also became difficult for her. She would wake up hourly at night and sometimes she would not go back to sleep. Her behavior worsened. She had full blown melt-downs daily. At this point, we began seeing a new neurologist who referred us to a GI specialist. The GI doctor offered to enroll her in feeding therapy--but she knew how to eat, she just did not want to. We concluded her feeding problems were behavioral and Melissa's neurologist changed her medications. Topamax was replaced with &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-6283-2034/risperidone-oral/risperidone-oral/details\">Risperidone</a>, a behavioral medication, and there was a change in Melissa.</p><p>The resulting change was like the lifting of a dark cloud. In the next year, Melissa started to flourish again. She learned how to ride a bike, swim, cook, and began to talk in full-blown sentences. And, we stayed like this for about 3 years.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"2015.+10+years+old+.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb567edaa7256d04ae22de6_2015.%252B10%252Byears%252Bold%252B.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3><strong>2017 - A MISTAKEN DIAGNOSIS OF TSC: AGE 11</strong></h3><p>At age 11, the neurologist was still puzzled by Melissa's lack of a diagnosis and ordered genetic testing. I was told that the test came back positive for a mutation in a gene called TSC2, which causes Tuberous Sclerosis. Tuberous Sclerosis is a rare disease associated with epilepsy, development delay, and benign tumors. It seemed like we had an answer. &nbsp;At the time I felt happy because we finally knew what was causing her problems, or at least we thought we did. &nbsp;At the same time I was upset because the tubers associated with TSC that I was now expecting are scary. &nbsp;After we learned her diagnosis, Melissa had an EKG, MRI, and an ultrasound of her lungs, kidneys, and liver looking for tumors, which all came back normal—they did not find anything. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"genedx.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb567edffcf884e9b923ced_genedx.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Editors note: This was not a mistake by GeneDx, they clearly labeled this a VUS. &nbsp;Somewhere a clinician decided that the patient had TSC. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>2019 PART 1 - TREATING THE TSC: AGE 13</strong></h3><p>We kept Melissa on the same medications, which worked well until age 13 when Melissa started to eat compulsively. &nbsp;She gained weight. The Risperdone and Depakote together felt like a ticking bomb. She started to eat more and more, compulsively and it started affecting her health. It became so bad that we had to hide food from her. She developed high cholesterol. &nbsp;Also, due to the high doses of drugs, she had very high prolactin and was not not getting her period. Something had to change.</p><p> At this point, her neurologist believed that Melissa should be placed on <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-152072/afinitor-oral/details\" target=\"_blank\">Afinitor</a> -- a cancer drug used to stop tumors developing in TSC patients -- and referred us to a specialist in Tuberous Sclerosis. Interestingly, the specialist was adamant about not placing Melissa on Afinitor, as she believed Melissa did not need it. (I should have listened to her.) Instead, she prescribed <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-18137/zonisamide-oral/details\" target=\"_blank\">Zonisamide</a>, another AED, and started to decrease the Depakote.</p><p>The Zonisamide caused vomiting and Melissa’s appetite went from voracious to non-existent. &nbsp;Then, in the last week of the Depakote, for the first time, she had a Grand Mal seizure. I had never felt so helpless. The neurologist concluded that this seizure was caused by the cessation of the Depakote. &nbsp;We went back to Depakote and replaced the Zonisamide with another AED, <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-17984-5005/trileptal-oral/oxcarbazepine-oral/details\" target=\"_blank\">Trileptal</a>. It was somewhat effective, but Depakote was essential—as soon as we tried to lower the dosage, Melissa had absence seizures again.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"2019 (1).PNG\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb567eec4d92500bb93afb5_2019%2B%25281%2529.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3><strong>2019 GETS WORSE: PUBERTY</strong></h3><p>Puberty began. Her period was extremely painful, heavy, and long. I found a gynecologist who specializes in treating patients with special needs. After the consultation, we decided to place Melissa on birth control to lessen the intensity of her periods. I was presented with several options including the pill, patch, shot, and an IUD. </p><p>I chose the <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/depo-provera/about/pac-20392204\" target=\"_blank\">Depo-Provera</a> shot, a long lasting hormonal birth control injection. It seemed at the time to have the least amount of side effects. &nbsp;Unlike the IUD, it did not require an invasive procedure nor require sedation. I was told the Depo-Provera shot could cause depression, but at the time I did not think this was likely. &nbsp;</p><p>Editor’s note: See this <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/iud\" target=\"_blank\">recent article on IUDs</a> in the <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/syngapblog\" target=\"_blank\">#SyngapBlog</a> for more on this topic.</p><p>Three days after the injection, Melissa became psychotic. Melissa had never needed a behavior plan, so the school staff did not know what to do with her. They restrained her to the point of almost breaking her hands. &nbsp;This was the second time she had been harmed at school. &nbsp; I immediately pulled her out and &nbsp;placed her in a new school. &nbsp;</p><p>She was expelled for behaviour after three weeks. &nbsp;It was almost the end of the school year and putting her in a new one so close to summer didn’t make sense. &nbsp;I decided to homeschool her. In 6 weeks she made great progress but started to ask why she wasn’t going to school. &nbsp;I put her in a summer school for 2 weeks. &nbsp;She was always excited to go to school, but as soon as she entered the classroom and I left, she would go full-blown psychotic for hours. &nbsp;</p><p>We went to a psychiatrist who helped me understand what had happened. &nbsp;She explained that when children with special needs have depression, it typically manifests as aggression. The Depo shot had likely caused the behaviours at school. &nbsp;The psychiatrist diagnosed Melissa with an anxiety disorder and Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) . I learned that she had been traumatized when she was inappropriately restrained at school. The resulting PTSD led to increasing anxiety and then more aggression in the school setting. To help with her anxiety, the psychiatrist prescribed an anti-anxiety medication called <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-63990/lexapro-oral/details\" target=\"_blank\">Lexapro</a>.</p><p>In September, she started as a special school where she remains now.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"2019.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb567ed1ccbef41292b1864_2019.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3><strong>2019, WORSE STILL: AFINITOR</strong></h3><p>In September, Melissa's neurologist referred us to another epileptologist who specialized in Tuberous Sclerosis. &nbsp;This neuro recommended that we place Melissa on Afinitor to prevent lung tumors, which was a risk for teenage patients with TSC in their teenage years. We gave her Afinitor to be proactive, even though an earlier doctor had advised against it. &nbsp;How is a parent supposed to navigate when all these doctors have different opinions? &nbsp;</p><p>After a month of taking Afinitor, Melissa behaved in a way that felt suicidal. Just before Christmas, Melissa and her grandmother were out shopping. Without warning, Melissa ran out towards the street and laid face up, all while screaming, laughing, and trying to take her clothes off. When people tried to help her, she hit them away. Melissa went to the ER in an ambulance. </p><p>At Overlook Hospital, they put restraints on Melissa’s arms and legs. &nbsp;I started arguing with the doctors, I told them that she was not a criminal. &nbsp;They had security remove me from the room and they threatened to call the police. &nbsp;I remember that day as the day I almost went to jail.</p><p>Since that Christmas day, I've lost count of how many times Melissa has been taken to the ER by ambulance, restrained and sedated. One time, they took her in the back of a police car, in handcuffs. &nbsp;</p><p>This became our horrible new normal. I stopped arguing. &nbsp;I would tell the paramedics that it needed to happen, and then leave the room. As much as it hurt me, I knew it was necessary. During these manic episodes, Melissa went in and out of her normal self. She would respond normally to a question and then, a moment later, be manic again. Doctors would attempt to sedate her, but it would not work. </p><p>This pattern of ER, drugs, and manic episodes had to stop. The drugs were not working. At my request, the specialist agreed to place her on <a href=\"https://www.epidiolex.com/about-epidiolex\" target=\"_blank\">Epidiolex</a>, but we needed insurance approval. In February 2020, after a VEEG, Melissa came home with a new medication plan: <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-158687/onfi-oral/details\" target=\"_blank\">Onfi</a> (epilepsy medication, benzodiazepine), Lexapro (anxiety medication), Risperidone (behavior modifying medication), and <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-64439/abilify-oral/details\" target=\"_blank\">Abilify</a> (mood modifying medication for depression). The plan was to remove the Risperidone and Onfi when the Epidiolex was approved.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"2019 (1).PNG\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb567edcf34e712f785f7dc_2019%2B%25281%2529.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3><strong>2020: MOTHERING IN DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: AGE 14</strong></h3><p>When COVID-19 hit, we were just beginning to remove the Risperidone and increase the Abilify. My state was mandated to quarantine. &nbsp;For two months, I isolated Melissa and my mother from everyone. She was not allowed to go out, and no one allowed in. &nbsp;Melissa began to regress cognitively</p><p>Melissa's personality shifted, almost split, in the isolation. She started to talk to herself as if there was someone else with her, or better yet, another Melissa. I would hear her say, <em>I’m going to break the TV. Melissa don’t do it, Mommy will be mad. Yes, do it. No, don’t do it, bad girl.</em> And then she would hit herself. Or she would hit herself and scream at herself to stop.</p><p>She became hyperactive as well and her meltdowns were worsening. &nbsp;She would not stand still for more than a minute at a time, she could no longer watch a movie, or play on her iPad. She would sit and then a minute later, she would jump out and run. Melissa’s meltdowns, which she would typically get around the time of her period, were increasing in intensity and length.</p><p>After hearing about all of the changes that Melissa was experiencing, her psychiatrist advised me to keep her on the Risperidone until things got somewhat back to normal. It would be safer to not reduce the Risperidone while in isolation due to these dramatic personality changes. We didn’t know if her behavior was related to side effects of her medications or all the changes brought about by the pandemic. &nbsp;Despite keeping her on the Risperidone, Melissa’s behaviors worsened and became mania. Every time we got in the car, she would get anxious and try to open the car door, sometimes trying to jump out in front of cars in an attempt to escape the confined space. &nbsp; In response, her psychiatrist increased her medication. </p><p>At one point, Melissa was on 6 mg of Abilify once a day and 2 mg Risperidone 3 times a day. Yet, her behavior was getting worse and worse. &nbsp;How were we giving this child all these medications and they weren’t helping? &nbsp;I was so consumed managing the crisis, I didn’t have the time to articulate these questions. &nbsp;For two months we were just in damage control mode, day and night. &nbsp;We were zombies.</p><p>Melissa’s care team and I were all puzzled on how my child could be on such heavy doses of two powerful antipsychotic medications, one anxiety medication, and a benzodiazepine- but was still &nbsp;having all of these behavior issues. One day, she tried to escape again, and I took her to the ER. &nbsp;Melissa was given a dose of a different benzodiazepine this time called <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-8892-5244/lorazepam-oral/lorazepam-oral/details\" target=\"_blank\">Lorazepam</a>. The Lorazepam made her even more anxious and agitated. &nbsp;She needed a dose of an antipsychotic called Haldol and that is when we discovered that benzodiazepines did not work for Melissa. &nbsp;That’s when I learned that, for some patients, including Melissa, Benzodiazepines have “<a href=\"https://www.acep.org/how-we-serve/sections/toxicology/news/july-2017/paradoxical-reactions-to-benzodiazepines-who-gets-them-and-why/#:~:text=First%20described%20in%201960%20by,been%20reported%20in%20medical%20literature.\" target=\"_blank\">paradoxical reactions</a>.” &nbsp;Instead of calming the patient, they could actually cause anxiety or psychosis. Onfi, one of her daily medications at the time, is a benzodiazepine.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"2019 (1).PNG\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb567ed9ab1ad81af4c5b00_2019%2B%25281%2529.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3><strong>ANOTHER GENETIC TEST &amp; EPIDIOLEX: AGE 14</strong></h3><p>One of Melissa’s doctors expressed some skepticism about her diagnosis of Tuberous Sclerosis (TSC). Melissa didn’t have any of the typical symptoms of TSC, like tubers, angiofibroma, or tumors. He requested another genetic test. &nbsp;We thought little of it, our focus was on meds. &nbsp;But this is how genetic tests are, you give a sample and move on to help your medically complex child, never stopping to think about what results might come and what they might mean.</p><p>While we were in isolation due to COVID-19, we were fighting for insurance approval for Epidiolex. &nbsp; After 4 insurance denials and five long months of fighting to get it approved, we finally won. We were supposed to start slowly. During the first week, we started at 1.1 ml, with no issues. The second week coincided with the week of her period, and we increased to 3.3 ml. Things were touch and go, but meltdowns were expected. In the fifth week, we increased to 5 ml. &nbsp;All hell broke loose.</p><p>Melissa became a new type of psychotic. This was worse than the Depo-Provera triggered episode. For the first time, she became violent and destructive. &nbsp;She started hitting my mother. &nbsp;She started hitting me. &nbsp;She would throw and break furniture. She would throw chairs at us. This happened every day, from 2 pm to 8 pm, like clockwork, nonstop. There was nothing that triggered her. One second she was calm and then the next, she would throw her iPad across the room and then she would come after &nbsp;one of us. Anything and everything she could put her hands on she would throw.</p><p>After an entire month of enduring this behavior, we became desperate. I spoke to her psychiatrist begging her to give us another medication. She refused. She wanted Melissa to get another VEEG in July 2020 and then revisit the discussion on medication. The day of the VEEG could not come soon enough.</p><h3><strong>AN UNEXPECTED SYNGAP DIAGNOSIS</strong></h3><p>In mid-July, four days before Melissa’s long anticipated VEEG, I received a phone call about her recent genetic test--the Invitae Epilepsy Panel. The panel had come &nbsp;back with unexpected results: a pathogenic diagnosis for SYNGAP1. </p><p>It was at that time I realized that the original genetic test from GeneDx said she has a variant of unknown significance (VUS) for TSC. But for some reason our clinicians treated it as if it were certain, and as if she had TSC. &nbsp;That ultimately led us to put Melissa on unnecessary medications such as the Afinitor, a tumor medication. So, while I felt relieved that we had a diagnosis that fit everything, I was extremely frustrated that the original misdiagnosis of TSC had led us to take measures that we now know were unnecessary. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"iep af.JPG\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb567eed4c5d7208ecc5508_iep%2Baf.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3><strong>ESCAPING FROM THE HOSPITAL</strong></h3><p>Four days later, we were admitted to the Hackensack Hospital in order to get the VEEG. The first day went well, Melissa was happy and calm, but she was also adamant that it was time to go home. Usually, Melissa loves staying in hospitals, going to doctors, and getting blood work done. This time she tried to escape.</p><p>It took six hospital security officers to stop her; she was restrained and sedated. But the sedative drug was ineffective, to the amazement of the hospital staff. They tried for three days. &nbsp;Then I learned that the medication they had been giving her was <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-6685/ativan-oral/details\" target=\"_blank\">Ativan</a>, which is just another name for Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine. &nbsp;If they had studied her records they would have known the negative effect this would have on her. They switched to Haldol, but after 4 days, of restraint, sedation or both, the damage had been done.</p><p>Then, to add insult to injury, the resident doctor informed me that his floor was not equipped to handle Melissa. She was cleared by the neurologists and the pediatrician, but not by the hospital psychiatrists--who had given her a drug we knew didn’t work, which caused psychosis. I then received a phone call from a psychiatric facility two hours away from my house, informing me that Melissa`s bed was ready.</p><p>I have never felt the terrible desperation caused by that call before. </p><p>I knew I had to be strong; I had to &nbsp;find a way to get her home. I begged the psychiatrists to let me take her home, but they refused. I tried to explain that her behavior was &nbsp;because she just wanted to be in a familiar place. They told me they would give me 24 hours, and that only if she was calm could she go home. I prayed, and I prayed. We kept telling her she was going home &amp; they sedated her. &nbsp;This did the trick. &nbsp; She calmed and the next day we were allowed to go home.</p><p>Melissa was discharged with half of the dosage of Onfi and Lexapro that she was taking before, and the psychiatrists also prescribed <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-20575/geodon-oral/details\" target=\"_blank\">Geodone</a>, a new antipsychotic medication, and Depakote. I was under the impression that when we got home, everything was going to be fine. I was wrong. After 10 minutes in the car, Melissa kicked the seat, tried to open the door, and attacked my mom. &nbsp;I was on a mission to bring this girl home. I don’t know how, but we got there.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"2019.PNG\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb567ee6ff3cf8d4fa84848_2019.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3><strong>FIGHTING WITH &amp; FOR MY CHILD</strong></h3><p>From that day onward, until 10 days before I wrote this, my life consisted of Melissa hitting my mom and me, hitting the animals, attempting to start the stove, throwing things everywhere, and breaking things. She cut my mother's face open and dislocated my toe. &nbsp;We are covered with bite marks and bruises.</p><p>As much as Melissa is fighting us and herself, I am determined to fight for her. She is not only going through all of the side effects of the anti-epilepsy medications, &nbsp;but she is also dealing with psychosis, anxiety, and cold-turkey withdrawal from Risperidone, Abilify &amp; Epidiolex as well as decreases to her other meds: Lexapro &amp; Onfi. &nbsp; They also added Geodone and Depakote. &nbsp;In the long run, these were good choices, but doing them all at once was tough.</p><p>I kept asking the doctor for an “as needed” dose of Risperidone, but she refused. The doctor told me that if Melissa had another meltdown, I would have to admit her into a psychiatric facility.</p><p>We blocked off the majority of the house, only allowing her to go to the bathroom, her room, kitchen, and my mother’s room. We removed everything that could hurt her—the TVs, silverware, furniture—we kept only our beds. I stopped working, but this was not sustainable. </p><h3><strong>CALLING FOR HELP BUT KEEPING MY LITTLE GIRL</strong></h3><p>The two months of fighting her every waking moment pushed me to a point where I had nothing left. &nbsp;Things were not changing or getting better. &nbsp;I started to question if I was the right thing for her -- she needed more than I could give. I called Emergency Medical Services and they took her. The paramedics already knew her, they had been there the day before. I called and told our doctor my fear that, if we continued like this, my child would hurt me or I would hurt her. I could not allow this to happen. My home was not the right place for her now.</p><p>A social worker got involved and started to try to find a facility to place her for medication management. Melissa needed a one-on-one caregiver, and none of the facilities close to my home had the capacity to care for her needs. The only facility that could accept her was the place two hours away from my house. The facility staff told me that they would have her picked up and transported to the location, and I would be unable to ride with her in the ambulance or follow behind to see the facility. Melissa would have to stay for a minimum of 20 days. She would have a one-on-one caregiver most of the time, but she would also have a roommate. &nbsp;I almost died that day as I imagined Melissa going away.</p><p>All I had in mind was my little girl, surrounded by strangers, asking <em>“Where is Mommy?” </em>Sometimes Melissa does not remember what happens during her meltdowns; one day, after she broke our door, she asked me <em>“What happened?”</em> I also worried that if I sent Melissa away, the experience might traumatize her further, and I might never have my baby back. </p><p>I decided that I was willing to endure the aggression, as long as she was home. I was going to find a way.</p><p>I begged the doctor to prescribe Haldol, telling him that she was experiencing withdrawal and that I was certain she would be fine in a few days. He was a Godsend and gave me the medication for 5 days. I also got an additional 15 days from her psychiatrist. I did have to give her Haldol a few days—mostly giving her a quarter or a half pill, and only twice a whole pill. I also gave her Benadryl, to calm her down.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"2020.PNG\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb567ee3eac20a674f90833_2020.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3><strong>PRESENT: AUGUST 2020</strong></h3><p>This brings us to the present day. Now she is only on 5 mg of Lexapro (which is half of what she was taking before), Depakote and Geodone twice a day. The aggression from before has been replaced by calm and focus. As long as we don’t leave her alone, because it only takes a moment for her to turn, and if she turns, it’s impossible to get her back. &nbsp;Ever since the Depo shot she does this thing where her pupils get huge and it is as if we are dealing with another person. &nbsp;This is what I mean by “turning” it is so hard.</p><p>We are constantly redirecting her, reminding her of things she likes, as a result fewer things get broken. She has started to have seizures again since she is only on Depakote, but this time they are different: a combination of paralysis and jerking movements, with an eye twitch.</p><p>Melissa’s anxiety is extreme. She is fearful of many new things now such as the rain. The rain induces an anxiety attack now. &nbsp;Showers too have become anxiety inducing for Melissa. There are days that we try for hours to get her to shower without success. My mother gets frustrated, but I tell her to pick and choose our battles. Some days, we make do with baby wipes in lieu of a shower. At least she is home, where she belongs, and not trying to hurt us or herself.</p><p>Melissa continues to have problems sleeping and she has developed new compulsive behaviors. &nbsp;We give her melatonin every night, but she wakes up throughout the night multiple times. &nbsp;She will seek out my room or my mother’s where she can relax and go back to sleep. She has some compulsive behavior: right shoe on first, wash left armpit first, light switch off then on then off. If you ask her to get something, and somebody else brings it, she will take it back to its original place and then bring it to you. She also has tics, which started a few years ago.</p><p>These days I need to be careful with texting. &nbsp;It has become a trigger for her when I pick up my phone. &nbsp;She’s afraid I’m going to call 911.</p><p>Melissa can understand and speak (within her limits) three languages: Portuguese, Spanish, and English. You can prompt her on all three and she will answer or act upon it. Her verbal skills have come a long way, but she struggles to read. I’ve noticed that her seizures can be brought on by her attempts to read, even when normally controlled by medication. </p><p>Some of Melissa’s quirks and affections have not changed. &nbsp;Melissa continues to be picky when it comes to food. She will eat the same thing for 6 months and then she changes to something else. She is still fascinated by electronics and enjoys &nbsp;certain TV episodes that she can watch over and over again.</p><p>When she speaks, she makes strong eye contact and she loves hugs, kisses, and any sort of physical contact from her loved ones. I’ve even seen her blow kisses to boys. Before the onset of her psychotic episodes, Melissa, her grandmother and I, would go to museums, restaurants, parks, or Chuck E. Cheese weekly. We would travel at least twice a year, and during the summer, we would go to Six Flags with my mother. I hope that we can do these things again some day soon.</p><p>I know there will be a day where I will have to place her somewhere. But I would like to place her in residential living, not into a psychiatric facility, and on our terms. It is my mission that this day will not come anytime soon. Right now, all I want is for her to have some peace. I need her to have the same peace she had when she was younger, because my poor girl is lost right now and I don’t know how to help her.</p><h3>WORD OF THANKS </h3><p>Once we had the SynGAP diagnosis, I reached out to an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SyngapResearchFund\" target=\"_blank\">online SynGAP support group</a>. &nbsp;It was July when I connected with SRF. &nbsp;Peter put me in touch with the <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/family-empowerment\" target=\"_blank\">SRF ambassador</a> for my state. &nbsp;She spent hours with me. &nbsp;She connected me to a leading NY Epileptologist who sees SynGAPians. &nbsp;She was a support when I was desperate. &nbsp;She is a Godsend. &nbsp;I am very grateful for all her help.</p><h3>AFTERWORD</h3><p>The first 15 years of Melissa’s life have been hard. &nbsp;The reason SRF exists is so that the rest of it doesn’t have to be. &nbsp;</p><p>Science is moving fast and we are hopeful that the labs and companies looking at SynGAP will bring therapies to the market in a few years. &nbsp;Indeed, we are standing up a digital natural history study right now in order to make sure these treatments can move through clinical trials as fast as possible. &nbsp;But trusting the existing efforts to “cure” patients is nor enough. &nbsp;</p><p>As parents who love their children diagnosed with SynGAP, we are doing everything we can to accelerate translational science towards precision therapies. This is why SRF funds leading scientists, both those who are established in the gene and newcomers with expertise in areas that we need. &nbsp;</p><p>When will our work be done? Only when there are precision therapies for our loved ones, so we don’t have to subject them to litany of side effects, titration challenges, and medication errors that Melissa’s story makes so clear. Only when the thousands of girls and boys, men and women, with undiagnosed SynGAP, just like Melissa, are identified and treated. &nbsp;Only when this disease (and its treatments) stops sapping savings, testing marriages, exhausting parents, and traumatizing, limiting, and holding back those whom it affects. &nbsp;</p><p>Until then, at SRF—those of us who have a loved one with SynGAP—don’t have a choice: we know our children are mighty and this disease is horrid. &nbsp;We will keep working with scientists, mobilizing resources and telling our stories until our kids get better. &nbsp;</p><p>Join us, <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/contact-us\" target=\"_blank\">volunteer</a> &amp;/or <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/donate\" target=\"_blank\">donate</a>, there is good work to be done.</p><p><br></p><p>‍</p>",

    "Post Body": "<p><em>This article is written by SYNGAP1 parents for SYNGAP1 parents. It is not medical advice. Our intention with this article is to enable families to have informative conversations with geneticists, genetic counselors, and other medical professionals.</em></p><p>When it comes to SYNGAP1 disorder, mosaicism essentially means that some cells in the body have a pathogenic (disease causing) SYNGAP1 genetic mutation and the rest are normal and fully functional. This article discusses loss-of-function mutations that result in haploinsufficiency, causing intellectual disability, often with autism and epilepsy. Previously, this was called MRD5. When we say “the mutation” we mean a heterozygous dominant loss-of-function mutation in SYNGAP1. Examples include mutations that cause a stop within the protein coding region, a splice mutation, and some amino acid changes.</p><p>To discuss mosaicism we will describe three different classes that are seen. The different classes are based on when the mutation occurred: early or late in the developing embryo, or in a parent’s body.</p><p><strong>1) Most <em>de novo</em> mutations are not mosaic</strong></p><p>For most SYNGAP1 patients, the mutation happened very early on, either in their parents egg or sperm cells, or very soon after the egg and sperm joined together to create the zygote. In this case all (or the vast majority) of the cells in the SYNGAP1 patient carry the mutation.</p><p><strong>2) Two types of mosaicism: with and without SYNGAP1 symptoms</strong></p><p>For mosaic SYNGAP1 patients, the mutation happened some time later in the development of the embryo, which means some of their cells continued to split and develop without the mutation, and some split and developed with the mutation, leading to a patchwork of cells with or without the mutation in different spots in the body.</p><p>Have you ever seen a mosaic tile or pavement? That is a simple visual of how the cells end up in a mosaic person.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"Texture library © 2019 Dmitriy Chugai\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7a69c86828c90550cbf7c_Screenshot%2B2020-02-14%2Bat%2B2.16.29%2BPM.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Texture library © 2019 Dmitriy Chugai</figcaption></figure><p>If the mutation happened early enough during the initial cell divisions, the mutated cells end up riddled throughout the body in patches, including the brain, causing some degree of SYNGAP1 disorder. This is called <strong>somatic</strong> mosaicism. Somatic means cells of the body. There are a few known low-level somatic mosaic patients, both within the online communities and in the literature[1]. These patients are thought to have a somewhat milder form of SYNGAP1 disorder because some of their cells are normal (more on that later). </p><p>Sometimes, if the mutation happened later on in the development of the embryo, the patches of mutated cells are limited to a smaller region or tissue. Sometimes a patch will be limited to the ovary or testis. This is called <strong>germline</strong> or gonadal mosaicism and is a subset of somatic mosaicism. A person with germline SYNGAP1 mosaicism would likely not show any symptoms of SYNGAP1 disorder because the cells in their brain are not affected.</p><p>Most SYNGAP1 disorders are <em>de novo</em> (new, spontaneous) and therefore not inherited from either the mother or father. The exception to this are people with either low-level somatic mosaicism or germ-line mosaicism. They, like affected SYNGAP1 patients, are carriers of the SYNGAP1 mutation and have a 50% chance of passing it down to their children. If a patient’s mother or father is a carrier of SYNGAP1, then all that patient’s cells will have the mutation because the mutation is present from the very start of conception. Likewise, SYNGAP1 mosaicism is always <em>de novo</em> and it is not possible for a mosaic parent to have a mosaic child. Therefore, if parents already have one biological child with SYNGAP1, unless the child is mosaic, it is worth getting tested to find out if either of the parents have low-level mosaicism. It is also informative<em> </em>to have any future embryos tested for SYNGAP1. </p><p><strong>How can you find out if you have mosaicism and are a carrier of SYNGAP1? </strong></p><p>Somatic mosaicism can be detected from testing cells of the body (a simple blood draw or cheek swab will work). Germline mosaicism however, can only be detected by testing the egg or sperm cells. This is difficult for two reasons: 1) obtaining egg cells is not straightforward and, 2) the egg or sperms you choose to test may not have the mutation, leading to a possible false negative result.</p><p>So what should a parent of a SYNGAP1 child do if they want to have more biological babies? First, rule out low-level somatic mosaicism with a blood test or cheek swab. Secondly, for each future pregnancy, utilize non-invasive screening panels which can detect SYNGAP1 mutations through a blood test [2]. Taking a sample of the placenta through amniocentesis can also indicate the presence of SYNGAP1 mutations in the fetus. Finally, if getting pregnant through IVF, perform pre-implantation genetic diagnosis on the embryos to rule out SYNGAP1 disorder. </p><p><strong>What is the prognosis like for somatic mosaic SYNGAP1 patients?</strong></p><p>We don’t know for sure. It depends both on how many mutated cells exist and their location, neither of which we can truly measure without doing an autopsy of the brain. A blood test can only determine the extent of mosaicism in the blood cells. Some genetics labs will release a percentage of mutated cells found in the blood, others will not. The reason why some labs won't is that blood cells are not the best approximation for the brain cells. So even if you are told you've say a 20% somatic mutation in the blood, it could be higher or lower in the brain where the SynGAP protein is expressed. A blood test is also a point in time sample. So the percentage reported could change when another sample is tested. Skin cells are a better approximation for brain cells because they originate from the same cell line during fetal development (ectoderm). Families may opt to do a skin biopsy to get a better approximation, but ultimately we don't know what percentage of SYNGAP1 mutated cells will result in symptoms. The overall percentage may not even matter if the cells are concentrated in one particular area of the brain or another. Lastly, SYNGAP1 is a spectrum disorder, with severity of symptoms not yet linked to any particular mutations. So it is very difficult to say the severity or symptoms for a mosaic person.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"Explanatory graphic from Poduri et al [6]\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7a69c58c836a7fa6bb7ee_Screenshot%2B2020-02-14%2Bat%2B2.11.22%2BPM.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Explanatory graphic from Poduri et al [6]</figcaption></figure><p>Of the somatic mosaic SYNGAP1 children known to the family community, they have many of the same symptoms, delays and challenges as other SYNGAP1 kids and typically require the same therapies. However, they are known to walk and talk. There are also germline mosaic parents known to the community who are themselves unaffected. In the literature we know of one mosaic father who had a more severely affected daughter. He is described as having learning difficulties[1]. We don’t yet know of any very low-level somatic mosaic patients who are completely unaffected or very mildly affected. </p><p><strong>Mosaicism in other diseases</strong></p><p>A recent study of mosaicism of various epileptic encephalopathies found that 8% of apparently unaffected parents had some form of low-level or germline mosaicism. Most parents were symptomless or had minor symptoms (e.g. febrile seizures as a child)[3].</p><p>A study of mosaicism of Dravet patients also found that patients with mosaicism had on average a milder presentation of the disease[4].</p><p>In other genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, mosaic people are also thought to be sometimes more mildly affected, however the percentage of cells detected in the blood has not been found to be an accurate predictor of outcome.

For example he hates the sound of the turning signals in the car and we have swings, trampolines and crash mats in the house. When his sensory system is out of wack his brain is a mess and he bangs his head on the floor.</p><p>The hardest part for me with Syngap is that he can't speak even if he really wants to. He only says a few words but tries really hard to tell us what he wants.</p><p>The other hardest part is that he has seizures and that scares me a lot. &nbsp;Some of Ty's seizures are when his eyes roll mainly when he eats or is tired. He also has absence seizures which is when he is awake but not there. He had a grand-mal seizure once and his longest seizure lasted for 1 hour when we went to France. That was very scary! Ty has a rescue medicine to stop long seizures and after my uncle who is a doctor gave it to him, the seizure stopped but he still had to go to the hospital.</p><p>He takes seizure medication everyday and that helps him a lot and has seizure cameras in his room to make sure he is safe at night.</p><p>Ty loves a lot of things like swimming, listening and playing music, playing with his toys, jumping on the couch, trampoline and his bed, giving kisses, hugs and driving around in the car. He is funny, smart and loving. </p><p>Having a brother that is special is not always easy but he is funny, smart, amazing and loving and I would not trade him to be normal but I do hope that they find a cure to help make his life easier. &nbsp;</p><p>If you ever meet someone that is different then please take the time to get to know them and be nice to them. </p><p>You can learn more about Syngap at <a href=\"http://www.syngapresearchfund.org/\">www.syngapresearchfund.org</a></p><p>And follow my brother's adventures at: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/supersyngapian\">www.facebook.com/supersyngapian</a></p><p>Nahia</p><p><br></p><p>‍</p>",

    "Post Body": "<h3><strong>WE NEED MORE RESEARCHERS</strong></h3><p>As a community we are unified by having a loved one who suffers from a SYNGAP1 variant. &nbsp;We all want our children to receive a therapy that will help improve their level of SynGAP protein expression. We are fortunate that a number of scientists are looking at various aspects of SynGAP and that a few potential therapies exist in labs. &nbsp;But these treatments are still months to years away from making it to our loved ones.</p><p>Numerous important topics around SynGAP still need to be understood. &nbsp;We only have about a dozen labs on earth working on SynGAP. &nbsp;While these scientists are exceptional, curing a disease quickly requires a big team.</p><p>Getting researchers interested in a new gene isn’t easy... &nbsp;You need to entice them to study the gene, support their start-up costs, &nbsp;help them connect with existing scientists, and be available for the path to them being an independent SYNGAP researching lab. It’s tricky.</p><h3><strong>WHAT IF</strong></h3><p>Wouldn't it be amazing if a rising star researcher from a major institution was a specialist in something that we have not yet understood about SYNGAP1? Equally incredible if that thing was something that could actually give us tools to address the problem and increase the level of the protein in the brain? &nbsp;Even better if that person was already connected to serious SynGAP researchers?</p><p>Ideally, that person would actually care for and love someone with SynGAP -- like we do. &nbsp;This way, their motivation would go beyond the altruistic desire to help humanity coupled with the practical need to progress in their career, to a personal mission. &nbsp;Having a relative of a SynGAP patient who met all these criteria would be incredible.</p><h3><strong>WAIT, WHAT, THIS IS REAL?</strong></h3><p>Epigenetics is the study of what is outside of the gene --of how everything else in the genome affects the regulation of a gene. &nbsp;It is a body of knowledge that we do not have for SynGAP.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.med.upenn.edu/hellerlab/\" target=\"_blank\"><div><img alt=\"Heller Lab Homepage\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb56bd1e52c82f399cc24be_lab.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></a><figcaption>Heller Lab Homepage</figcaption></figure><p>The Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania is <a href=\"https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2019/march/penns-perelman-school-of-medicine-ranked-3rd-best-medical-school-in-the-united-states#:~:text=March%2012%2C%202019,10%20research%2Doriented%20medical%20schools.\">ranked 3rd in the nation</a>. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://hosting.med.upenn.edu/epigenetics/\">The Penn Epigenetics Institute with 30 core faculty members</a> is one of the best in the US.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.med.upenn.edu/hellerlab/\">Dr. Elizabeth Heller</a> is one of those faculty members. &nbsp;She is an Assistant Professor of Pharmacology who has already made significant contributions (see <a href=\"https://www.med.upenn.edu/hellerlab/assets/user-content/documents/20200108.HellerEA.FEDS.CV.Alternate%20Format%20with%20grants.pdf\">resume</a>). &nbsp; Her lab has the team, tools and experience to develop the Epigenetics knowledge we need about SynGAP. And…</p><h3><strong>SHE’S FAMILY</strong></h3><p>Elizabeth Heller is also an aunt to a 14 year old girl in the US with a SYNGAP1 genetic variant. &nbsp;She’s close to her niece and understands how SynGAP turns a family's life upside down. &nbsp;On top of that, through designing this project, she has come to appreciate how important SYNGAP1 is and now finds herself genuinely fascinated.</p><h3><strong>THIS IS BIG</strong></h3><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"SHS_1883-3.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb56bd27f7f1cf6320e8c41_SHS_1883-3.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>When SRF received a request to support a postdoc in Elizabeth Heller’s lab for two years to study the epigenetics of SYNGAP so that we could identify other mechanisms to help SynGAPians, we were thrilled. &nbsp;When we heard that Dr. Elizabeth Heller did her postdoc at <a href=\"https://www.rockefeller.edu/news/17947-elizabeth-anne-heller/\" target=\"_blank\">Rockefeller</a> (read the last line in that article, really) with <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/bateup\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Helen Bateup</a> and knows <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/gavin\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Gavin Rumbaugh</a> -- she actually was connected to SRF via SGN at Gavin’s recommendation -- we felt very lucky. </p><p>I spend hours talking to and collaborating with other rare disease leaders and I'm not exaggerating if I say that any of them would be grateful for this opportunity.</p><h3><strong>AND WE ARE GETTING A GREAT DEAL</strong></h3><p>But two years of a postdoc, reagents, animal models and an assistant professor's time is expensive. Fully loaded this would cost over a quarter of a million dollars... $250,000. &nbsp;Fortunately, Dr. Heller has some flexible funding that will allow her to cover some costs and all she is requesting from SRF is the funding for the post-doctoral fellow. &nbsp;We can make $250,000 of research happen for $127,000. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>IT GETS BETTER</strong></h3><p>Three SRF Families have established a $60,000 matching fund! &nbsp;So we only need another $60,000 and this grant can happen.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"60kwaterfall.png\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb56bd266714f8d205cb713_60kwaterfall.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3><strong>HERE’S THE PLAN</strong></h3><ol><li>We have set up a <a href=\"https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/support-srf-epigenetics\">GoFundMe page to pool resources</a>.</li><li>Two families have already started raising money. &nbsp;We are grateful for their leadership and hard work.</li><li><a href=\"https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/super-syngapian-steven\" target=\"_blank\">#SuperSyngapianSteven</a>, recently diagnosed in California, <a href=\"https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/super-syngapian-steven\" target=\"_blank\">just raised over $5,000</a> </li><li>Chloe Smith, an Australian living in Sweden, <a href=\"https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/cycle4caspian\">is about to ride almost 250 miles (400+ kilometers) with her SynGAPian to raise awareness &amp; raise funds for this project</a>. &nbsp;<strong>#Cycle4Caspian</strong>. &nbsp;It is as impressive as it sounds, they just wrote <a href=\"https://www.jp.se/logga-in/familjen-cyklar-runt-vattern-for-forskning-om-trearige-caspians-ovanliga-diagnos\" target=\"_blank\">an article about her in the Swedish press</a>. &nbsp;Just below, you can see the graphic made for her by a #SyngapSibling who <a href=\"https://www.molliemarigold.com/\" target=\"_blank\">is a talented artist</a>. &nbsp;</li><li>With the matching fund we only need to raise $60,000 from the broader community. &nbsp;Then &nbsp;we will have the $127,000 necessary to make a significant contribution to the knowledge of SYNGAP1. &nbsp; </li></ol><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"caspianbike2.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb56bd2c2132371970e0cdc_caspianbike2.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3><strong>TIME IS BRAIN</strong></h3><p>The work in Dr. Heller’s lab can help us improve the therapies we know of that are currently in labs and help the community deliver therapies to our children in a time frame that matters. &nbsp;Our loved ones brains’ are being built right now.

In 2023, he will be 9.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Some company you've never heard of just announced that they have proven that their science -- which none of us can pronounce -- corrects SynGAP protein levels in cell lines, organoids (mini-brains) and animal models.&nbsp; Your heart is filled with hope and you smile mightily for the first time in years; you ask when your doctor can treat your daughter or son.</p><p>And then someone points out that first there need to be clinical trials.&nbsp; Unfortunately, despite knowing this day was coming for years, no one is sure exactly what to test, or how to measure it: in order to determine &amp; prove the drug works in humans. The company has concluded that the existing registry &amp; studies won’t satisfy the regulators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The company that has a potential cure for your child sitting on the shelf decides that they will launch their own natural history study. This will allow them to carefully study the disease, collect data and understand what to measure in a clinical trial. Best case scenario: it will take them three to six months to recruit the patients, another year to run the study (bringing patients in to sites around the country) and only then can they design a trial.</p><p>Given that exclusion criteria often limit the patients in the trial to specific age ranges, your child may not qualify for the clinical trial by then. After the trial -- if approved by the FDA -- then might be able to access the therapy.&nbsp; So you are told to please go home to your sick kid and hang on for “a few” more years.</p><p>You find yourself incredibly angry.&nbsp; Rightfully, you are frustrated.&nbsp; After all, we've known for years that this was going to happen and yet we weren’t ready.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; Why haven't we done more?&nbsp; Didn’t they understand that <em>Time is Brain</em>?&nbsp; Oh wait, <em>we are they</em>.&nbsp; We’re the parents of rare kids.&nbsp; It’s on us.</p><h4>‍</h4><h4>‍<strong>Will past be prologue? The Dravet Story</strong><br></h4><p></p><p>This is not a dark story contrived to scare the audience.&nbsp; It’s essentially what happened to Dravet, when a company called Stoke showed they could treat their devastating disease.&nbsp; Before I go on, let me be clear: the Dravet community and Stoke are utterly incredible and we have nothing but admiration for them and their work. SRF is built on the model of DSF.&nbsp; But in spite of their brilliance, tierless work and resources, it took them two years to go from success in the lab to dosing a patient. They had more registries, patients and studies than the SYNGAP community does by a long shot.&nbsp; But still, we must ask, <em>can we move faster.</em><br></p><p>Two years ago, after creating SRF I was at the <a href=\"https://www.dravetfoundation.org/dsf-funded-research/dsf-roundtable/\" target=\"_blank\">Dravet Syndrome Foundation Roundtable</a>, learning how they accelerated research for Dravet.&nbsp; It was December 2018 in New Orleans.&nbsp; I remember exactly where I was sitting, in the back of the room, when <a href=\"https://www.aesnet.org/meetings_events/annual_meeting_abstracts/view/500169\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Lori Isom shared her work</a> showing that instead of 50% of the mice dying from seizures, 99% survived.

And what will we measure in a clinical trial to convince the FDA to approve the drug? Will we understand the disease well enough to answer that question?&nbsp;<br></p><p>Right now we don’t.&nbsp;<br></p><p>SYNGAP is a tricky disease.&nbsp; Seizures. Drops. Sleep. Autism. Tantrums. Intellectual impairment. Not talking. Low tone. Diapers. Scratches.&nbsp; Bites.&nbsp; Different levels from patient to patient. <em>What do you measure?</em>&nbsp; What would actually change -- in all patients -- to show that a drug had worked?<br></p><p>We do know quite a bit.&nbsp; Dr. Smith-Hicks reviewed all the SynGAP studies at our <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/srfrt2\" target=\"_blank\">2020 Roundtable</a>.&nbsp; Dr. Holder is doing detailed analysis of the patients he sees (as discussed in a SRF <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/webinars/dr-jimmy-holder\" target=\"_blank\">webinar</a> last month).&nbsp; Prof. Scheffer’s team wrote a <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/syngap-patient-neurology-paper-five-things-every-parent-needs-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">tremendous paper</a> in Neurology (2019) on 57 patients.&nbsp; Simons Searchlight <a href=\"https://www.simonssearchlight.org/research/what-we-study/syngap1/\" target=\"_blank\">runs a great study</a> interviewing parents each year.&nbsp; But these all suffer from lack of clinical data &amp; scale.&nbsp; They do not take advantage of all the countless doctors visits and interventions our children have month after month.&nbsp; Also, it’s not possible for a handful of highly trained researchers invested in SYNGAP1 to keep up with the population as it <a href=\"http://syngap.fund/census\" target=\"_blank\">continues to grow</a>.<br></p><p>This is why we have partnered with <a href=\"https://www.ciitizen.com/syngap1/\" target=\"_blank\">Ciitizen</a>: they are using the most advanced technology available and regulatory expertise and executional ability to gather every page of the patient's medical records, have robots turn each sentence that matters into machine-readable codes and make that data available for researchers, for free. ASAP.&nbsp; We are lucky to have this chance.&nbsp; Let’s not waste it.<br></p><p>This isn’t an intellectual or abstract exercise.&nbsp; It’s doing the work to prepare for a clinical trial.&nbsp; It’s making sure we don’t waste a year doing an “Observational Study” because data sufficient to satisfy the regulators wasn’t gathered, organized, published &amp; available and ready for use.</p><p><br></p><h4><strong>Ciitizen has the potential to get our kids treated at least one full year sooner. </strong>&nbsp;<br></h4><p>This is why SRF is paying all the cost of Ciitizen and making it free to families: because the more data that is readily available, the easier it will be for a company to get the FDA to let them do trials quickly.&nbsp; That’s relief for your child and mine twelve months sooner.&nbsp; </p><p>It’s 2023: there is a drug that we think works based on lab and animal work.&nbsp; Tony is 9.&nbsp; Am I spending another year--with multiple drugs, scratches, diapers, sleepless nights, exhaustion, and complex diets--waiting?&nbsp; Or am I seeing a clinical trial begin--maybe even signing him up. If he’s not too old?&nbsp; Is your child in there too?</p><p>That depends, in part, on you.&nbsp; If we all sign up for Ciitizen; if we do what we can now to get data ready for sharing.&nbsp; So far For Tony, and for your loved one.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.ciitizen.com/syngap1/\" target=\"_blank\">Sign.

It goes like this…</p><p><em>“He has SynGAP.”</em></p><p><em>“What’s that?”</em></p><p><em>“He has a spontaneous mutation in his DNA, as a result he has half of a critical neurological protein, as a result he has epilepsy, behaviors, low tone, global delays, sleep issues and intellectual disability.”</em></p><p><em>Awkward silence/niceties followed by “can’t the doctors do anything?”</em></p><p><em>“Not really, they don’t know enough and there are very few patients. The research will take time and there aren’t enough organizations like </em><a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SRF</a><em> funding research.”</em></p><p><em>“How many patients are there?”</em></p><p><em>Awkward silence followed by “some say 200–300, other say up to 400, nobody actually seems to know, but there is a new family on the </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SyngapGlobalFamilySupport/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Family Support</a><em> list every week! Let’s say 350…”</em></p><p><em>“Shouldn’t you know that; how many kids have your kid’s disease?”</em></p><p><em>“Yes, yes we should.”</em></p><p>I am tired of this conversation. I don’t understand why we don’t have a better answer. So I’ve put one together. This number is wrong, it’s too low, but it’s a start.</p><h2><strong>WHAT’S BEHIND THESE NUMBERS?</strong></h2><p>This list of countries and numbers has been shared with us by the leader of the specific countries’ patient group or by other parents; we are connected to these groups through the <a href=\"https://www.syngapglobal.net/\" target=\"_blank\">SynGAP Global Network</a> of which SRF is the US node. Backup also exists in the form of lists kept by people who have been patient leaders in this space for years. We are lucky to have these parents on the SRF leadership team. Finally, many of us are on closed lists to share experiences — of which <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SyngapGlobalFamilySupport/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Family Support</a> is the most respectful and welcoming — and we can identify patient family geography that way.</p><h2><strong>YOU CAN MAKE THIS NUMBER BETTER!</strong></h2><p>If you look at a geography, be it a country or a US state, and you think our number is low, please <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.com/contact-us\" target=\"_blank\">let us know</a>. We are happy to update this article as often as needed. We are sharing this list because it’s a number we should know and we can make more accurate together. Every patient deserves to know about the community they belong to.</p><h2><strong>BTW, BEING BRITISH DOESN’T MEAN YOU’RE MORE LIKELY TO GET SYNGAP</strong></h2><p>As you look at this list, you may be surprised to see that a country with a population of <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/articles/overviewoftheukpopulation/november2018\" target=\"_blank\">66 million</a>, the UK, has the second most SynGAPians: 77. The story here is worth knowing as we think about how many kids around the world may have SynGAP and be undiagnosed. In the UK, via the DDD, they took <a href=\"https://www.ddduk.org/intro.html\" target=\"_blank\">12,000 kids with developmental disorders and sequenced them</a> to see what they could learn. This surfaced most of the diagnoses in the UK. Let’s assume they got every case in the country (definitely wrong and low) then that is 1.1 SynGAP patient per million population (or ~7,700 cases globally— meaning we know of ~5% of the SynGAP population). You can do the math below but it suggests that ever number below is too low by a factor of 1.5 (France) to 1,200 (India); not to mention the countries we don’t even list here like China or Indonesia.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"Original global data when this article was first published.

Or an MD. Or any form of science degree: I was a freshman in high school when I last took a biology class.</p><p>I am a parent — an informed, hopeful parent — who founded <a href=\"http://www.syngapresearchfund.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SRF</a> with my husband Mike last year, an organization that is laser-focused on identifying treatments targeting the root cause of the debilitating neuro-developmental condition that is SynGAP.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"The SRF logo with our three core values.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7ae43697ac2aaece81d98_image-asset.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>The SRF logo with our three core values.</figcaption></figure><p>So what is the basis for our hope? Since our son Tony was diagnosed as one of <a href=\"http://bit.ly/SRF_4PbyP_HowMany\" target=\"_blank\">~430</a> known patients with SynGAP last year, my husband and I spent countless hours talking to neurologists, researchers, biotech professionals, and other rare disease advocates, trying to understand whether there could be — in the timeframe that matters — research on SynGAP that could lead to a cure for his disease.</p><p>The scientists were very patient with us. And as we reflected on everything they shared, we concluded that there was indeed good reason to hope that advances in research could help our child.</p><p>We concluded further that there were key gaps between the work being done in the ordinary course in academic research labs (important research, but targeted toward advancing knowledge &amp; science generally, not infused with the urgency that drives us) and the work that could help this generation of children (our children). We knew we had an opportunity to do something — everything we could do — to develop therapies for SynGAP patients.</p><p>What will we do with our organization? We are focused on understanding the current landscape of SynGAP research, identifying key gaps in knowledge, and fillings those gaps so that we can establish pathways to treatments.</p><p>We need those pathways because, as the incredible Dr. David Fajgenbaum (read his <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43355196-chasing-my-cure\" target=\"_blank\">book</a>) recognized, and as I would have explained it to my mom: “Doctors don’t cure disease. Drugs do.”</p><p><strong>What kinds of drugs could help our kids?</strong></p><p>Right now, two approaches seem most compelling (small molecule and ASO — more on these below), but there are other approaches (esp AAV-mediated gene therapies) that we need to explore as well.</p><p>Then, to start, what is the root cause of SynGAP that we are trying to attack?</p><p><strong>Ninth grade biology redux: </strong>typically developing people have 23 pairs of chromosomes — one copy of each is inherited from mom &amp; dad. Chromosomes are extremely long strands with repeating series of four different nucleotides (3 billion base pairs in total), which are bound together in the ‘double helix’ called DNA. We can think of these nucleotides as the letters or building blocks of our genetic code. Almost every cell in our body contains these chromosomes, which act as a blueprint for our bodies, personalities, capabilities etc. The DNA distributes that blueprint by making instructions (RNA) that gets translated into proteins — the proteins that are needed to grow, walk, speak, roll our tongues, etc. etc.</p><p><strong>What they didn’t teach me in ninth grade biology (or I don’t remember):</strong> When the average person’s DNA is created, ~100 of these 3 billion base pairs undergo <em>de novo</em> (new) mutations — for no particular reason, an incorrect nucleotide gets inserted into the DNA sequence. The significant majority of the time, these <em>de novo</em> mutations have zero impact (~99% of DNA is “non-coding,” i.e., is just part of a long strand that doesn’t get translated by the RNA into proteins, and many other mutations are harmless). Our children’s <em>de novo</em> mutations in the <em>SYNGAP1</em> gene, however, have devastating consequences.</p><p><strong>Why is a <em>SYNGAP1</em> mutation so bad?</strong> Because the <em>SYNGAP1</em> gene is responsible for creating SynGAP protein. SynGAP is one of the key proteins that enables learning and memory — it is critical to enabling neural plasticity. Our children have one “good” copy of the <em>SYNGAP1</em> gene and therefore generally have a smaller amount of the SynGAP protein (we presume ~50% but that is a critical research topic — more on that below).</p><p>In scientific terms then: <em>SYNGAP1</em> is a <em>single gene</em>, <em>de novo</em> (not inherited) <em>loss-of-function </em>mutation that causes <em>haploinsufficiency </em>(one gene doesn’t work properly). The problem we have is that our kids have less of the protein than they need.</p><p><strong>And that last part is a good thing.</strong></p><p><strong>Why?</strong> Because, in principle, if we could find ways to <em>make more SynGAP protein</em>, then our kids may be able to have typical neural plasticity, which could give them a better shot at being able to learn, remember, and develop in a more typical way, and also not suffer from seizures. (Importantly, <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/articles/46752\" target=\"_blank\">research shows that synaptic function can be “rescued”</a>: i.e., if you increase the protein levels in adolescent mice, who have <em>Syngap1</em> mutations at birth, they stop seizing and show other signs of improved behavior.</p><p><strong>How would we make more SynGAP protein? </strong>There are three main theoretical approaches, the first two of which are exciting possibilities for the relative near term: <strong>small molecules</strong> (pills that work to increase the amount of SynGAP protein expression), <strong>ASOs</strong> (small strands of nucleotides that interact with the RNA from the gene that is good at making the protein, and causes it to make more), and <strong>gene therapy</strong> (viral vectors that go in and fix the underlying issue in the DNA).</p><p><strong>Why hasn’t it been done yet? </strong>Lots of reasons. The <em>SYNGAP1</em> gene was only found to create problems in humans ~10 years ago. The SynGAP protein is expressed in the brain, so any treatment would need to pass the blood-brain barrier. And, of course, this is an ultra-rare disease, one of a rapidly growing, long list of mutations. The number of researchers / scientists / biotechs with the skills to work on these problems is growing a lot more slowly.</p><p><strong>What has been done so far? </strong>For SynGAP to be attractive to biotechs, the syndrome needs to be as well-understood as possible. We are fortunate in that several academic labs (Jacques Michaud, Rick Huganir, Gavin Rumbaugh, Jimmy Holder, Marcelo Coba, Helen Bateup, others) have built models (iPSC lines, organoids, and mice) of the disease. These models are valuable because they represent important functions of SynGAP: iPSC lines (induced pluripotent stem cell lines) are models of patient neurons, which are derived from patient blood samples; organoids are more complex models of multiple cell types from the brain; and mice can be bred to have a specific SynGAP mutation from a patient known to have the disease, or to have a classic “knock-out” of the gene, resulting in 50% expression of SynGAP protein.</p><p>By creating these models, these labs have helped us to understand some of the functions of SynGAP in the brain. These models (which are — generally speaking — available in the public domain) also create a mechanism for us to study what treatments may be effective.</p><p><strong>What needs to be done next? </strong>We need to (1) build better models, (2) build screens to identify which small molecules are most relevant, (3) pursue “ASO” approaches, which would increase the amount of protein in the brain, and (4) prepare for success: identify biomarkers and build a biobank so that researchers will know when they have been successful and can test their potential drugs against patient samples, as well as work towards a natural history study, which can help accelerate the timing of clinical trials once a treatment approach is found.</p><h2><strong>1: BETTER MODELS</strong></h2><p>If we are going to build a drug that increases the amount of SynGAP protein, we need to understand as well as we can: what it is that the SynGAP protein does, what helps or hinders its expression, how much of the protein our kids express, etc.</p><p>Right now, we know some of the functions of the SynGAP protein, but we don’t know all of them. We don’t know how much SynGAP protein our children produce (does the “good” <em>SYNGAP1</em> gene produce the same amount it normally would, or does the error on the “bad” gene either get in the way or allow it to produce more)? Is any of this correlated to the different mutations that our children have and the way they present the disease? (i.e., some of our children are wheelchair-bound, while some can run; a few can speak while most are functionally non-verbal; many have intractable seizures throughout their lives while a few have never had an abnormal EEG). How much good SynGAP protein is needed to improve associated symptoms?</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.com/grants\" target=\"_blank\">SRF’s 2019 grants</a> into Dr. Holder and Dr. Huganir’s labs included work to build more mice and iPSC models. A significant portion of this work is focused on determining the level of SynGAP expression in different patients — which we need to understand very specifically, if we are going to develop a therapy that increases that expression (see more on this below).</li><li>SRF is currently fundraising for a grant into a lab that has developed SynGAP patient organoids — which could be useful to better understand the function of SynGAP protein, as organoids show how proteins get expressed in many different cell types in the brain, whereas iPSC lines (the historical basis for our models) show how proteins get expressed in one cell type, the neuron.</li></ul><h2><strong>2: HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENS (HTS) TO IDENTIFY SMALL MOLECULES (PILLS):</strong></h2><p>HTS are one of the exciting places where advances in technology make rapid progress possible: historically, testing whether a certain drug would work for a certain problem required feeding the drug into tiny pipette after tiny pipette and measuring the results, one by one. HTS today rely on complex tools that allow the investigators to test tens-of-thousands of potential compounds in rapid succession.</p><p>The promise of a HTS is that this rapid testing mechanism will allow researchers to identify molecules that were originally identified as treatments for other conditions, but which also increase SynGAP expression (so-called “repurposing” of existing chemicals). If found, we would be able to rapidly treat our children with compounds already known to be safe.</p><p><strong>What has been done so far?</strong></p><p><strong>A — “N of 1” studies have indicated that repurposed pills can reduce symptoms of SynGAP: </strong>Statins, the well-known cholesterol drugs, appear to have had an impact on cognitive functioning, behavior and seizures for a few SynGAP patients, when administered on a compassionate use basis.</p><p>This is interesting at a basic level because it indicates that a pill, designed for another purpose entirely, may affect the cognition and behavior of a SynGAP patient. But it is potentially <em>quite interesting</em> because of research that shows that, while SynGAP models typically show unusually high levels of “Ras signaling” (a pathway within the cells), models treated with lovastatin have their Ras signaling reduced to more normal levels — which is to say, that the underlying neurobiology that we know is related to the SynGAP protein, is affected by a statin. Which <em>could </em>mean that the amount (or efficacy) of the SynGAP protein itself is affected, which, if true, would imply that it is possible to address the problem our children have at its root cause.</p><p>(You can read more in this<a href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/cap.2018.0159\" target=\"_blank\"> paper</a> and this<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0039-1681066\" target=\"_blank\"> paper</a>, and for parents, if this sounds interesting, you can talk to your doctor about gaining access to lovastatin for your child as an N of 1 trial, recognizing that the potential benefits here are not yet fully understood.)</p><p>Further research is underway at James Clement’s lab in India as well as at Gerhard Kluger and Till Hartlieb’s clinic in Vogtareuth, Germany, to find out more about whether statins do in fact regulate levels of SynGAP protein and if the success with single patients can be replicated in a larger population.</p><p><strong>B— An HTS screen is underway at Scripps Research: </strong>Dr. Rumbaugh at Scripps Research has a grant from the NIH to perform HTS in neurons with only one “good” copy of <em>Syngap1</em>. The idea here is to find a drug-like substance that makes this “good” copy work even better to compensate for the copy that is broken by de novo variants. Scripps is a great place to perform HTS because it owns one of the largest drug libraries in the world, including the largest drug repurposing library, call <a href=\"https://reframedb.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ReFRAME</a>. The models that Dr. Holder and others have built will allow Dr. Rumbaugh to test if drug candidates identified in HTS are effective in models made from SYNGAP1 patients.</p><p><strong><em>What needs to be done next? </em></strong>SRF is currently evaluating building out so-called biochemical assays (vs. the phenotypic or cell-based assays that Dr. Rumbaugh’s screen relies on), which can be a simpler and more adaptable approach to HTS. However, the drawback to these “simpler” assays is that they are less directly related to the cause of <em>SYNGAP1</em> disorders (i.e. the failure of brain cells to make enough SynGAP protein).</p><p>We are also evaluating supporting the build-out of other model types that can be used for HTS and exploring additional drug libraries.</p><h2><strong>3: ANTISENSE OLIGONUCLEOTIDES (ASOS):</strong></h2><p>If one of the <em>SYNGAP1</em> genes does not express SynGAP protein (or expresses an insufficient amount), but the other does, there is a theoretical possibility to increase the expression of the SynGAP protein from the “good” <em>SYNGAP1</em> gene — which could simulate a “normal” environment. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are a mechanism to do just that.</p><p><strong>What are ASOs? </strong>Back to that ninth grade biology discussion:<strong> </strong>proteins get made when DNA copies itself, producing mRNA (messenger RNA). The mRNA will then produce a certain quantity of the relevant protein — exactly how much is determined by the “instructions” on the underlying mRNA.</p><p>Enter ASOs: an ASO is a small piece of single-stranded DNA that, in our case, would find the part of the mRNA regulating the protein expression. Instead of that part of the mRNA acting to reduce protein production, that part of the mRNA will meets its ASO counterpart and both will dissolve. The good <em>SYNGAP1</em> gene would then act without a regulator, and produce more SynGAP protein than it normally would.</p><p>In other words, ASOs for haploinsufficiencies like SynGAP would “stop the stop” — to use some highly imperfect analogies, be the method by which a local train turns into an express train, or be a way to drink water directly from a jug rather than through a straw.</p><p><strong>Is that really possible? </strong>Yes. ASOs are a novel modality for sure, but they have been proven to be effective in Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Batten’s Disease, are currently being trialed in Dravet Syndrome, and are a topic of early biotech interest for other haploinsufficiencies, including SynGAP.</p><p>ASOs are also not an easy modality to dose: for the ASO to operate, it needs to go to the place where the protein is doing its work (i.e., the brain), which is to say, ASO treatments are expected to be conducted via spinal tap. Further, ASOs typically degrade every few months, so a patient being treated by an ASO would need to undergo that spinal tap a few times a year.</p><p>That said, the ASO approach could theoretically address all of the symptoms of SynGAP by addressing the root cause of the problem of SynGAP, i.e., insufficent protein expression.</p><p><strong>So what are we doing about it? </strong>SRF’s grant to Dr. Huganir’s lab and our Australian colleagues’ grant to the Florey Institute were focused on supporting development of ASOs.</p><p>Also, the work we are doing around improving the number and types of SynGAP models will be supportive of ASO work, as it is (clearly) critical for us to understand the specifics of how much SynGAP our children express.</p><p><strong>What is next?</strong></p><p>We need to do more modeling of the protein type. That is, we need to better understand which “isoforms” of SynGAP (the 20 different forms of SynGAP) are typically expressed, and in which ratios, so that we can make sure that the upregulated protein mimics the typical expression. Dr. Huganir’s continued ASO work focuses on that area, and as mentioned, this area of drug development is one of high interest for biotechs.</p><h2><strong>4: PREPARING FOR SUCCESS: BIOMARKERS, BIOBANK, AND A NATURAL HISTORY STUDY</strong></h2><p>WHEN our focused research teams identify drug target candidates (small molecule, ASO, or otherwise), they will need to make sure that the drugs they find are actually impacting the amount of SynGAP protein in humans. In order to do this, we will need to identify so-called “biomarkers” of the protein — other things that are always there when the appropriate amount of SynGAP protein is in the body. We are currently fundraising for a grant in this area.</p><p>And, when these research teams identify these drugs, they will want to test them against as many mutation types as possible before trying them in humans. So, we will work on building a “stem cell repository” — we will work with families and researchers to draw patients’ blood, differentiate that blood into stem cells, and ask for those stem cells to be stored in a location that all SynGAP researchers can access. This approach will reduce the barriers to progress for academics and smaller biotechs, making it easier for those focused on other diseases to choose SynGAP as their next target.</p><p>Finally, and importantly, we will support and leverage existing work related to a “natural history study.” A natural history study is a well-organized and structured look at the clinical symptoms of the disease, as it presents in our patients over time. A well-designed natural history study <em>can</em> accelerate the choices researchers make in designing clinical trials, and in some cases can ultimately serve as the control arm of a clinical trial for rare disease, which reduces the timeframe to treatment.</p><p>So, there you have it. The basis for my (informed, impatient) hope. The basis on which we founded SRF: that to find a cure for SynGAP will be hard, but not impossible. Because SynGAP, for its dizzying range of symptoms, is, at its genetic core, a simple disease: a typo on a gene that causes less protein to be produced.</p><p>The dedicated researchers and scientists have made great progress in the last ten years. But there is much more to do and, by working together, I do believe that we can go far. And, for the sake of our kids, we must.</p><p><em>— </em><a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/team-profiles/ashley-evans\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Ashley</em></a></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"Ashley , John (1), Tony (5) &amp;  Mike , November, 2019. 📸 B.

SynGAP Research Fund is privileged to interview Dr. Bateup regarding her work for our SynGAP community. Below is our brief interview with her.</em><br></p><h3><strong>CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE ABOUT YOU AND HOW DID YOU GET INTERESTED IN SYNGAP MUTATION IN THE FIRST PLACE?</strong></h3><p>My <a href=\"http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs2/bateup/\" target=\"_blank\">lab</a> has been interested in understanding the molecular and cellular basis of neurodevelopmental disorders, with a focus on autism spectrum disorders, since I started as an independent investigator at UC Berkeley in 2013. Prior to that I was a post-doctoral fellow in Dr. Bernardo Sabatini’s lab at Harvard Medical School and a graduate student with the late Dr. Paul Greengard at Rockefeller University. As a graduate student, I studied the intracellular signaling pathways that are controlled by dopamine and how dopamine regulates motor behaviors. As a post-doctoral fellow, I became interested in neurodevelopmental disorders and ASD and investigated how mutations in genes associated with these disorders affect synaptic function and synaptic plasticity.</p><p>A major line of research in my lab is to define the synaptic, cellular and neural circuit level alterations that lead to the behavioral manifestations of ASD. We are also determining the relevant brain regions and cell types that are responsible for the different aspects of complex neurodevelopmental disorders. Much of our work thus far has focused on the disorder Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), which is caused by mutations in the <em>TSC1</em> or <em>TSC2 </em>genes. We have made some interesting discoveries in mouse models of TSC regarding cellular and synaptic changes that we think drive behavioral alterations including repetitive, restricted behaviors and reduced cognitive flexibility. We are very interested to understand whether these cellular changes are unique to TSC or whether they may be common to other neurodevelopmental disorders with similar manifestations, such as SYNGAP1.</p><p>Our lab has been funded by the <a href=\"https://www.sfari.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI)</a> for the past five years and I have followed closely their efforts to identify genes associated with ASD risk. One of the top ASD risk genes, <a href=\"https://gene.sfari.org/database/human-gene/SYNGAP1\" target=\"_blank\">according to SFARI</a>, is SYNGAP1. When I read more about SYNGAP1 disorder and what is known about SynGAP the protein, I became more and more interested. This was for several reasons. One is that our lab is very interested in understanding how changes in synaptic function and plasticity lead to behavioral alterations; therefore studying a protein that functions at the synapse is particularly interesting for us. Second, <em>Syngap1 </em>appears to be highly expressed in the striatum, which is the brain area that we have been primarily studying. However, essentially nothing is known about how loss of SynGAP function affects striatal synapses or striatal-dependent behaviors. </p><p>To learn more about SYNGAP1 disorder and <em>SYNGAP1 </em>gene functions, my post-doc <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=F7RT0L8AAAAJ\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Jillian Iafrati</a> and I attended the International SYNGAP1 conference at Scripps, Florida in 2018. We were excited by the joint effort between basic scientists, clinicians and parents to understand more about this gene and this disorder and felt that we might be able to contribute.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>WHAT ARE THE HIGHLIGHT OF YOUR RESEARCH RECENTLY?</strong></h3><p>Although it is still preliminary, we are very excited about some recent data showing that deletion of <em>Syngap1</em> from one specific striatal cell type in mice is sufficient to induce behavioral changes. Specifically, our data suggest that loss of <em>Syngap1 </em>from striatal neurons impairs motor learning in mice. In addition, our initial results suggest that mice with mutations in <em>Syngap1</em> may preferentially develop habitual behavior strategies, at the expense of more flexible goal-directed behavioral control. At the cellular level, we have seen that haploinsufficiency of <em>Syngap1</em> leads to changes in synapse structure in striatal neurons, similar to what has been reported in other neuronal types. Although this is still very much a work in progress, it suggests that loss of Syngap1 from striatal neurons is likely to alter their function and may be an important contributor to the repetitive, restricted and inflexible behaviors observed in SYNGAP1 disorder.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"Bipan Deb, Dan Kramer, Jillian Iafrati, Villy Karalis, John Blair, Katie Cording, Erin Aisenberg, Kamran Ahmed, Katie Benthall, Polina Kosillo, Helen Bateup in Santa Cruz, CA\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7a7205e9171bc7efd1843_SantaCruz_8-19_boardwalk-group1.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Bipan Deb, Dan Kramer, Jillian Iafrati, Villy Karalis, John Blair, Katie Cording, Erin Aisenberg, Kamran Ahmed, Katie Benthall, Polina Kosillo, Helen Bateup in Santa Cruz, CA</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>WHAT ARE THE OBSTACLES IF ANY WITH YOUR RESEARCH?</strong></h3><p>As with most research, the experiments we do are time consuming and it takes a while to get the results. We are using sophisticated mouse genetic models and it can take a long time to get the specific mice we need for a given experiment. In addition, the more complex behavior tests we do are labor intensive and low-throughput. While we have research funding for this work, it is still at a relatively small scale in terms of personnel and resources, therefore, like most basic scientists we are somewhat limited in terms of what we can accomplish (and the speed at which things move) by our need to continually seek funding. Another key question that we always consider is whether our findings in mouse models will translate into informative understanding and interventions for people. We try to design our experiments to be both controlled and translationally relevant but we are limited in the model systems we can study, particularly for behavioral disorders.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>WHAT ARE YOU MOST EXCITED RELATED TO SYNGAP RESEARCH IN THE NEAR FUTURE?</strong></h3><p>Based on the promising data we have collected so far, I am optimistic that our work will lead to new insights into disease mechanisms in SYNGAP1 disorder. I hope that with additional grant support from the NIH (which is currently pending) that we will be able to recruit another person to work on this project so we can continue it and expand the scope. While the first stage of the project—where we currently are now—is focused on understanding what goes wrong in the brain when <em>Syngap1</em> is mutated, the next stage of the project will be thinking about strategies to potentially help mitigate symptoms or improve the course of the disorder. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"Polina Kosillo, Katie Benthall, Helen Bateup, Katie Cording, Villy Karalis, John Blair, Dan Kramer, Kamran Ahmed during a lab retreat.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7a7207e4b283bf4c7decc_Retreat_2018_B-Lab.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Polina Kosillo, Katie Benthall, Helen Bateup, Katie Cording, Villy Karalis, John Blair, Dan Kramer, Kamran Ahmed during a lab retreat.</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.25%\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6A0gPV1SEKI?wmode=opaque&enablejsapi=1\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></figure><p>Dr. Bateup’s SRF Webinar: Loss of SynGAP function in the striatum leads to altered motor and habit learning shared on July 16th, 2020.</p><p>‍</p>",

The major focus of her research has been to investigate the mechanisms of epileptogenesis in translationally sound models of neurodevelopmental disabilities. During her training as an ICU resident doctor at Pune Institute of Neurology in India, Dr. Kadam has broad clinical exposure to epilepsy management.<br><br>She continued her epilepsy research in <a href=\"https://medicine.utah.edu/faculty/mddetail.php?facultyID=u0484511\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Edward Dudek</a>’s laboratory at Colorado while obtaining her PhD. The first granted U.S. <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20170281579A1/en\" target=\"_blank\">patent</a> of Dr. Kadam’s laboratory was on the age- and sex- dependent role of electroneutral chloride co-transporter in refractory neonatal ischemic seizures. Her laboratory was able to discover intervention to reverse the refractory neonatal seizure by studying neonatal seizure in mice models.</p><p>Her laboratory investigates various neurodevelopmental disorders—including SynGAP1—that result in genetic epilepsy. &nbsp;It is their mission to improve lives of children who are affected by these disorders. Dr. Kadam collaborates with<a href=\"http://neuroscience.bs.jhmi.edu/huganir/\"> Dr. Rick Huganir’s laboratory </a>to further study SynGAP1 related disorders using in vivo animal models. Furthermore, she is helping to establish a new clinic for SynGAP patients at Kennedy Krieger Institute.</p><p>Dr. Kadam continues to investigate pathogenesis of SynGAP 1 mutation while helping to identify evidence-based therapies for patients with SynGAP1 diagnosis. Her laboratory was able to identify abnormal underlying brain activity and high incidence of seizure during sleep by examining mouse model and overnight EEG from SynGAP patients. Her laboratory then discovered using a low dose Perampanel (a FDA approved anti-seizure medication, used in low dose may not prevent seizure) can help correct the high frequency abnormal brain activities during sleep in mice model. &nbsp;Her <a href=\"https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(20)30002-0/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">paper, Low-Dose Perampanel Rescues Cortical Gamma Dysregulation Associated With Parvalbumin Interneuron GluA2 Upregulation in Epileptic Syngap1+/− Mice,</a> &nbsp;came out in the past week in Biological Psychiatry.</p><p>Summarizing the paper, Dr. Kadam wrote, <em>“Perampanel is already FDA approved for use in children as an anti-seizure agent however the current dosing paradigm is that of slowing ramping up doses over a few weeks starting with the low-dose. As soon as kids are moved to the high dose side-effects are reported by parents and sometimes the drug is abandoned. &nbsp;What our data show is that low-dose by itself may have beneficial effects unrelated to &nbsp;its anti-seizure effects but ability to correct brain activity during sleep. &nbsp;I’m hoping our paper results in more neurologists trying this approach. There is already some anecdotal information from Texas that a SYNGAPian showed great improvements with low-dose PMP when it was started but had aggravation of side effects when the clinician upped the doses as per general protocol. &nbsp;A human trial would be good however very few clinics have a group of syngap patients at the same clinic.”</em></p><p>The biggest obstacle in her research is funding. She is currently pursuing NIH fund for her research in SynGAP1 haploinsufficiency on network dynamic using EEG both in mouse models and patient overnight EEG recordings. She continues to seek overnight EEG recordings from patient communities.</p><p>Dr. Kadam is excited to see ASO mediated therapeutics to help rescue SynGAP 1 level in the brain. She is currently seeking funding to use CRISPR/Cas technologies to create mice models for SynGAP patients to study specific phenotypes and to find potential biomarkers.<br><br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:426px\"><div><img alt=\"Members of the Kadam Lab: Divyam Satyarthi, Pavel Kipnis &amp; Brennan Sullivan  @Brennan_Sully .\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7a4dd5cb4fd5864368e08_Screenshot%252B2020-04-02%252Bat%252B7.39.25%252BPM.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Members of the Kadam Lab: Divyam Satyarthi, Pavel Kipnis &amp; Brennan Sullivan <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Brennan_Sully\" target=\"_blank\">@Brennan_Sully</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.25%\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/00cdXAoR_lg?wmode=opaque&enablejsapi=1\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></figure><p>Dr. Kadam kindly gave an #SRFWebinar titled SYNGAP1 Epilepsy Research: Insights into Mechanisms and Therapies shared on July 2nd, 2020.</p><p>‍</p>",

Thank you to everyone who participated, donated, or contributed in any way. <em>You </em>made it happen!</p><p>What is Sprint For Syngap, or <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/sprint4syngap\">#Sprint4Syngap</a> in social media-speak? On April 24, 2021, <a href=\"http://www.syngapresearchfund.org\">Syngap Research Fund</a> (SRF) families around the US and the world participated in a fundraising event to raise money for SynGAP1 research. At last count, donations topped over US$124,000. Wow!</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%\"><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/edlfSW1kvKE\"></iframe></div></figure><h2>‍<strong>Highlights &amp; Fun Facts</strong><br></h2><ul><li>There were 29 teams, 78 registered participants, and 900+ donors.</li><li>Participants raised a grand total of $124,664. Wow!&nbsp;</li><li>“Sprinters” participated in locations around the US, and also in Columbia, Hong Kong, Australia, &amp; Germany.</li><li>People walked, ran, cycled, strolled and salsa’ed. One Syngapian even invented “sliding for Syngap.” Any of these forms of sprinting were welcomed and encouraged!</li><li>The “official” distance was a 5K fun run, but folks adjusted as needed. Some did a 1K (half mile), and one super ambitious Syngap dad ran a 50K. That’s longer than a marathon!</li><li>We got a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/eFSi_3Y0FUU\">shout out from an NFL star. </a>&nbsp;Thank you, Henry Anderson.

For example, Boston Children’s Hospital is doing EEG biomarker work with funds from an SRF grant. And there is important patient data in the <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/10-reasons-we-chose-ciitizen-for-the-syngap1-digital-natural-history-study-srfdociitizen\">Ciitizen</a> database that needs to be analyzed. And since SRF's founders cover all overhead, every single dollar, shilling, peso or Euro raised goes directly to research that will accelerate therapies for our children!</p><h2><strong>Prizes Coming Soon</strong></h2><p>A big cheer goes out to all fundraisers. In addition to the shout out, many folks will be getting prizes! That’s right, these prizes will be shipped out soon:</p><ul><li>Raised $250? You’ll get a Sprint4Syngap Drawstring Bag</li><li>Raised $350? You’ll a Syngap Research Fund Hat</li><li>Raised $500? You’ll Get an 'Eat. Sleep. Cure SYNGAP1' mug</li></ul><h2><strong>Raising Awareness, Creating Community</strong></h2><p>In addition to being a fundraiser, Sprint For Syngap and events like it raise awareness for SynGAP -- such a new and mysterious word for many. Each step walked, each donation requested, each t-shirt worn helps educate others. So, great job on that front, sprinters! And last but not at all least, events like this help grow and strengthen the supportive community for Syngap families. It was great to see so many family and friends out to share the day. There was laughing and hugging and all out joy. As one parent said, “It was so refreshing to be somewhere where our children were fully accepted, loved and celebrated.” Wow! Let’s create more of this.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%\"><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4jYGJJnbLf8\"></iframe></div></figure><h2><strong>Save the Date</strong></h2><p>Sprint For Syngap will be back!

He is relentless &amp; passionate about driving research for SynGAP.</em></p><p>During Rare Disease Week 2020, I was honored to have represented SynGAP Research Fund and to make my first visit to Capitol Hill – as a rare disease parent, and as a patient-advocate. I had the opportunity to participate on a panel for the <a href=\"http://www.personalizedmedicinecoalition.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Personalized Medicine Coalition</a>’s (PMC) Personalized Medicine Caucus Briefing, focused on Technologies Advancing the Future of Personalized Medicine, alongside a wildly impressive group of industry professionals: Lance Baldo, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, <a href=\"https://www.adaptivebiotech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Adaptive Biotechnologies</a>; Keith Stewart, M.B, Ch.B., Director, Center for Individualized Medicine &amp; Professor of Cancer Research, Mayo Clinic; and Lauren Silvis, Senior Vice President of External Affairs, <a href=\"https://www.tempus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tempus</a>. &nbsp;The event was also written up in <a href=\"https://www.genomeweb.com/policy-legislation/congressional-caucus-working-raise-personalized-medicine-awareness-among\" target=\"_blank\">Genome Web</a>.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"Peter Halliburton - SRF Development Director, on the right.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7a9e5697ac2aa3ae80b43_IMG_7831.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Peter Halliburton - SRF Development Director, on the right.</figcaption></figure><p>So how do I fit into this panel? About a month ago, <a href=\"https://www.invitae.com/en/behindtheseizure/\" target=\"_blank\">Invitae</a>, a leading US genetics diagnostic lab, reached out to <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/team-profiles/mike-graglia\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Graglia</a>, and asked to be connected with me, after Mike and Ashley shared our <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/8-months-on-the-rollercoaster-of-mostly-uncontrolled-epilepsy\" target=\"_blank\">story</a>, and our SRF fundraiser that we held just following Carter’s diagnosis with Invitae in a meeting this past November. &nbsp;Our family’s diagnostic journey, and our gratitude in identifying a diagnosis resonated with their team, and was shared around the organization. They asked me if I would be open to sharing Carter’s story at PMCs upcoming caucus briefing, to provide a patient-perspective (or in our case, care-giver perspective) on personalized medicine. I jumped on the opportunity.</p><p>I made three points about why a precision diagnosis was so important.</p><ul><li>We immediately transitioned from having no idea what was going with out son to having a community of parents who had the same challenges, the emotional support has been a lifesaver.</li><li>Now that we know, we understand which medications and treatments are helpful or contraindicated for Carter. &nbsp;This gives tremendous peace of mind. &nbsp;Also, even though there is not a SynGAP-specific therapy yet, there will be and now that we have the diagnosis we will be able to find out about it.</li><li>Most importantly, we know where to lend our support. &nbsp;I know that the time and money I put into the Syngap Research Fund is going to help my son.</li></ul><p>The Congressional Personalized Medicine Caucus was recently established as a bicameral, bipartisan Caucus, created by Sens. Tim Scott (R-SC) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), and Reps. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) and Tom Emmer (R-MN). This will be an ongoing Caucus, but today’s briefing was an introductory meeting around the benefits of earlier detection, targeted treatment, and improved prevention strategies in personalized medicine.</p><p>Both Reps. Swalwell and Emmer have written bills that would call for expanded funding for genetic testing – which is something I am passionate about making available to anyone that needs it —because of the positive impacts that genetic testing and having a diagnosis have made on our family.</p><p>Having the opportunity to speak on this panel not only allowed me to share our family’s personal story, but to create awareness for Syngap, and to highlight the fantastic work that is being driven by Syngap Research Fund to accelerate treatments for our children. I spoke to the grants that SRF has made to Drs. Huganir, Rumbaugh, and Holder – and to the research that each has completed to-date – of which the audience and other panelists took note! &nbsp;For instance <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/organoid50k\" target=\"_blank\">our current campaign to support cutting edge research in Syngap Organoids illustrates how SRF is helping build the future</a>.</p><p>Following the panel, I was able to meet quickly with my local Representative, Congressman Van Taylor, as well as a staffer for Senator Ted Cruz, which was also a first! </p><p>A special thank you to Invitae &amp; PMC!</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:500px\"><div><img alt=\"20200226_122137_resized.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7a9e503adc2360aed000e_20200226_122137_resized.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>‍</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7aa2bda23284d0a7f3853_peter%2Bat%2Bpanel.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p><br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7aa36ed17679164139bd0_20200226_122911_resized.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:300px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7aa478ea29a257c03b4c6_IMG_7809.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure>",

    "Post Body": "<p><a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/meet-the-team\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mike</em></a><em> is the Managing Director of SRF.</em></p><p>At the end of the first quarter for 2020, we would like to share an update on SRF finances. &nbsp;Our mantra is Collaboration - Transparency - Urgency. &nbsp;We take transparency very seriously which is why we are sharing these numbers. &nbsp;We ask our families and friends to support SRF; as such, you deserve to know where the funds go and how they are used. &nbsp;You should expect this from any organization you support.</p><p>There are a few other reasons this is timely. &nbsp;First, we are about to expand the board and they need to understand where things sit as they become stewards of SRF on behalf of all US Syngap families. &nbsp;Second, we have an increasing number of donors who deserve to understand where SRF is deploying their funds. &nbsp;Third, Coronavirus. &nbsp;Not only has this a couple of things on hold that we needed to note — but it is also creating stress in the economy. &nbsp;We rely on generosity to fund our work, and now those in a position to give likely have less resources being met with more need. &nbsp;Finally, things have grown to a scale where an update is overdue!</p><h2>THE NUMBERS</h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"SRF Financials as of 1Q20\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7a6f8697ac25058e803b0_Screen%2BShot%2B2020-04-06%2Bat%2B6.51.35%2BPM.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>SRF Financials as of 1Q20</figcaption></figure><p>Above there are three versions of the same table. &nbsp;The table has SRFs financials broken down as Donations or inflows, less all of our outflows — Grants, Program &amp; Overhead — with the remaining Balance. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>TABLE A: ACTUALS AS OF 31 MARCH 2020</strong></h3><p>This table is based on the SRF bank account. &nbsp;It shows that, since the creation of SRF, we have raised over $500,000, granted over $112,000, and spent $42,000 on programs and $32,000 on overheads leaving a balance of $350,000. &nbsp;This is an accurate statement of our bank balance but not an accurate picture of what we have done or available funds.</p><h3><strong>TABLE B. ADJUSTED FOR DIRECT GRANTS IN 2018 TO 3 GRANTEES ($365,000)</strong></h3><p>This table includes the first three payments SRF made for grants. &nbsp;There were donations made directly to institutions on behalf of SRF so they did not touch our bank account; as a result were not included in Table A. &nbsp;In Table B, we have increased the Donations (inflow) and Grants (outflow) rows in 2018 both by $365,000. &nbsp;As a result it shows that SRF has raised over $900,000 to date, will have granted over $476,000, spent $42,000 on programs and $32,000 on overheads. &nbsp;The remaining balance will be $350,000.</p><h3><strong>TABLE C. ADJUSTED FOR PENDING GRANTS IN 2020 TO 3 GRANTEES ($310,000)</strong></h3><p>Table C builds on B. &nbsp;It includes the three grant payments SRF currently plans to make in 2020. &nbsp;These are obligations that SRF has incurred but not paid yet. &nbsp;At the moment, with everything on hold for Coronavirus, we are waiting for the labs to return to work before we cut checks. &nbsp;There are too many unknowns at the moment. &nbsp;We have increased the Grants (outflow) row in 2020 by $310,000. &nbsp;As a result it shows that SRF has raised $900,000 to date, granted over $787,000, spent $42,000 on programs.</p><h2>Q&amp;A</h2><h3><strong>WHAT'S IN PROGRAM?</strong></h3><p>SRF has a number of programs including Research, Awareness and Education, as well as Family Support initiatives. &nbsp;SRF engages in conferences that are deemed appropriate in supporting the furtherance of our mission to directly support research and continue to increase awareness. &nbsp;Two notable conferences attended for these purposes in 2019 were the Global Genes Rare Patient Advocacy Summit held in September and the Syngap Roundtable held at the American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting in December. &nbsp;SRF has promoted Family Support activities. &nbsp;For example, in 2019 we supported a Syngap Mom to attend a retreat with other Rare Disease Mom's, serving the dual purpose of giving needed support to a well deserving parent and thinking about how we could offer a similar program for Syngap parents. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>WHAT'S IN OVERHEAD?</strong></h3><p>As with most other organizations there are additional expenses to running a non-profit. &nbsp;SRF's overhead consists primarily of legal fees and accountancy fees. &nbsp;The legal fees are for consultative services and filings, such as those that allowed us to apply for our 501c designation, various correspondence and contract review. &nbsp;Having a professional legal team to assist in these matters helps protect the Foundation, providing surety that our engagements are handled in a manner that is supportive of our mission. &nbsp;We leverage a formal accountancy service to review our yearly financials, file taxes, and provide general support ensuring that SRF records all transactions in line with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). </p><h3><strong>WHY WERE THERE NO RESEARCH GRANTS PAID IN 2019?</strong></h3><p>It looks odd to see a gap in grants in 2019. &nbsp;It may help to know that the grants made in 2018 were cut on 12/31/18. &nbsp;Also we were still working with grantees on how to secure follow-on payments. &nbsp;We require annual reports that we share with our SAB before releasing, the timing here resulted in these second payments falling in 2020.</p><h3><strong>I THOUGHT 100% OF DONATIONS TO SRF WENT TO GRANTS, SO WHY IS THERE OVERHEAD?</strong></h3><p>100% of donations do go to grants. &nbsp;SRF's founders make dedicated donations to cover the very low (3.54% per table C) and unavoidable (legal, accounting) overheads incurred to run SRF.</p><h3><strong>WHY DID DONORS PAY 2018 GRANTS DIRECTLY?</strong></h3><p>In late 2018 SRF was eager to get work moving forward. &nbsp;SRF was a new legal entity and their 501(c)(3) tax status was not confirmed. &nbsp;The $365,000 was coming from two donors who preferred to give directly to entities with confirmed 501(c)(3) tax status, as a result these funds flowed to SRF grants but not through SRF's accounts.</p><p><br></p><p>‍</p>",

(See footnotes 1 &amp; 2) &nbsp;In order to determine which cells are required for which functions of the SynGAP protein, three types of cultures will be studied for multiple consequences of the disease gene. &nbsp;Cultures with normal inhibitory (GABAergic) neurons &nbsp;mixed with diseased excitatory (glutaminergic) neurons will be studied to determine the roles that the excitatory neurons play in the syndrome. &nbsp;Then &nbsp;normal excitatory neurons mixed with diseased inhibitory neurons will be studied to determine whether inhibitory neurons have a role in the syndrome. &nbsp;Finally, a culture where both excitatory and inhibitory neurons contain the disease gene will be studied, modeling the state of our patients. &nbsp;Comparing results from all three experimental designs will show exactly where the disease gene acts, and which effects originate in which cells.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>WHAT CAUSES VARIABLE EXPRESSION OF THE DISEASE?</strong></h3><p>The proposed research will identify changes in the proteins expressed (proteome) and the signaling markers present (phosphoproteomes) by comparing SynGAP disease cells to cells with a corrected version of the SYNGAP1 gene. &nbsp;The analysis will be done at the single-cell level. &nbsp;By recruiting many patients to donate a blood sample, many different variants can be studied. &nbsp;In addition, many different background genomes can be studied. &nbsp;By correcting the disease variant for each cell line, there will be a perfect control for every experimental cell line. &nbsp;Furthermore, by creating a variant that occurs in one patient on the genetic background of another patient, the &nbsp;influence of modifiers in the entire genome can be studied. &nbsp;Why do some patients have a mild expression of the syndrome, and some a severe expression? &nbsp;Is it the variant? &nbsp;The genetic background? Both? &nbsp;These experiments will directly address those questions.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>WHAT ARE THE BEST THERAPEUTIC TARGETS?</strong></h3><p>Finally, the Coba lab will &nbsp;pinpoint the &nbsp;processes and/or structures that malfunction by looking at a variety of levels, from intracellular to cellular processes, to signaling within and between cells, to neural networking. &nbsp;Broad protein expression and signaling will be measured inside individual cells of different types, neurotransmitter release will be measured (which is how neurons communicate with other cells), electrical activity will be measured (which may be relevant to epilepsy), and cell shape and surface changes (including those that correlate with neuronal plasticity and intellectual disability) will be observed with a powerful microscope. Much research limits its scope to one or a few of these measures. &nbsp;By looking at multiple types of changes over different locations it is more likely that targets for therapies will be found and ultimately understood.</p><h3><strong>INFLUENCE BEYOND THE RESEARCH RESULTS</strong></h3><p>The proposed research has the potential to allow a first-of-its-kind systems-level understanding of a neurodevelopmental disorder. The results gathered can lead to a significant increase in government and private funding for SynGAP1 Encephalopathy research. &nbsp;The next frontier will be to create multi-cell models like human brain organoids (mini-brains) and mouse models. &nbsp;The work proposed above will be performed &nbsp;in the Coba Lab by a postdoctoral fellow. &nbsp;Training another scientist in SynGAP biology is great news for all of us, as many hands make for faster progress. &nbsp;And <em>time is brain</em>.</p><ol><li> Berryer MH, et al. &nbsp;Decrease of SYNGAP1 in GABAergic cells impairs inhibitory synapse connectivity, synaptic inhibition and cognitive function.

    "Post Body": "<p>‍<strong>A new research project that is creating online measures specifically designed for genetic syndromes like SYNGAP1</strong></p><p>Neuropsych evaluations - ah, something Syngap parents are most definitely familiar with! If you have a child even with just a mild disability, much less one with a rare neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) such as Syngap1, you will have experienced at least one evaluation in your life. More likely, you will meet with a variety of evaluators on a regular basis.</p><p>We all know how important assessment or evaluation data is - especially when it comes to the type of data that helps to shed light on our children’s development and functioning. It is this data that essentially allows us to advocate for different supports and interventions, while giving us the opportunity to monitor progress over time.&nbsp;</p><p>Many families, however, are keenly aware of the difficulties traveling to specialty care centers for clinical evaluations. Travel is often expensive, time-consuming and stressful for everyone involved. While these evaluations are necessary for people with SYNGAP1 to receive the best care and for experts to learn more about each patient’s needs, it may be possible to reduce some of this burden by supplementing with online evaluation tools, easily accessible and facilitated through technology.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://jcu.edu/profiles/thomas-frazier-phd\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Thomas Frazier</a> has begun a project that will develop an online measures that help caregivers (parents) and patients to provide information online from the comfort of their home. Dr. Frazier is an Autism expert and is keenly aware of the challenges we face with our patients and their spectrum of communication ability. He has asked SRF&nbsp;to recommend a SYNGAP1 expert to give him gene specific knowledge and we are grateful that <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/0017627/constance-smith-hicks\">Dr. Connie Smith-Hicks</a> has agreed to collaborate with him.</p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>The Why</strong></h4><p><a href=\"https://jcu.edu/profiles/thomas-frazier-phd\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Frazier </a>seeks to address the lack of a tool specifically catered to collecting information from patients with neurodevelopmental genetic syndromes (NDGS) such as SYNGAP1. Many characteristics of existing tools are irrelevant to NDGS patients, as a result parents and clinicians waste valuable time together answering no to pages of questions. It is inefficient and depressing. Not to mention that data collection often requires difficult long-distance travel. We need a better tool. The new tool, designed with clinician, patient and caregiver involvement, will be more accurate, repeatable and sensitive to change than what is currently available.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4><strong>The What</strong></h4><p>The first set of measures allow caregivers to provide key data about their loved one across a range of different areas, such as sleep, anxiety, attention, and daily functioning. These measures are designed to be easy to complete, applicable to the full range of individuals with SYNGAP1, and can be repeated frequently to provide fine-grained tracking of progress.</p><p>A second set of measures will use webcam data to collect information directly from SYNGAP1 patients. These patient performance measures will look at attention to the screen, natural facial expressions, receptive language, and several other features. The measures will not require motor or verbal responses and, thus, are designed so that nearly every patient could complete them.</p><p><a href=\"https://jcu.edu/profiles/thomas-frazier-phd\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Frazier</a> envisions that these measures will be freely-available to all clinicians and researchers and could eventually become an important part of the ongoing evaluation and tracking needed for SYNGAP1 and other genetic syndromes.</p><p>The project was primarily funded by the <a href=\"https://ptenfoundation.org/?gclid=CjwKCAiAi_D_BRApEiwASslbJ2ArkltHXPpRkGiPRYjspqptj8lpjZNE4mvY8AV7C4iARUYww7N_eBoCRp8QAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">PTEN Research Foundation</a>. However, the measures that are being created are expected to be relevant to many different genetic syndromes. For this reason, the <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SYNGAP Research Fund</a> was asked to join the project so that the measures created are also designed for people with SYNGAP1. This structure allowed the<a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> SYNGAP Research Fund</a> to join at a lower cost relative to most research projects, while also ensuring that this new, innovative tool is valuable to people with SYNGAP1.</p><h4>‍</h4><h4>Join us. Support this work!</h4><p>SRF is excited to support this work and to partner with PTEN&nbsp;and other rare disease organizations. Collaboration is the first word in our mantra. By working together with the PTEN, ADNP, Malan &amp; other communities with a committed researcher like Dr. Frazier, we intend to develop a tool that gives better insight into our patients and is less of burden on their families &amp; caregivers. </p><p>‍</p><h4>We need to raise $14,200 to fund this grant. Please <a href=\"https://srf.salsalabs.org/frazier\" target=\"_blank\">donate here</a> to help us make this happen.</h4><p><br></p>",

Understanding phase separation will help elucidate facets of protein interactions and movements within the PSD. &nbsp;</p><p><br>Comparing the amino acid sequences of 132 different mammalian versions of Syngap1 shows an unusually high level of sequence conservation. &nbsp;One interpretation is that Syngap1 protein interacts with other proteins and itself along the entire length of the protein.</p><p><br>Dr. Kennedy shared her idea that Syngap1 acts as a dial to fine-tune the amount of AMPA-R at the membrane, by changing the levels of exocytosis and endocytosis. &nbsp;She pointed out that this idea is different from an interpretation favored by Dr. Huganir’s lab. &nbsp;When we hear that two scientists have differing interpretations we are excited, as it can lead to new experiments and important insights. &nbsp;We are lucky that Syngap1 biology is being studied in multiple labs with different specialties, and we look forward to more insights from Dr. Kennedy and her lab.</p><p>‍<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-floatright\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%\"><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KQ2QgiM5Iuk\"></iframe></div></figure><h2><a href=\"https://www.med.upenn.edu/hellerlab/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>ELIZABETH HELLER</strong></a><strong> OF UPENN, EPIGENETIC STUDIES OF SYNGAP1</strong></h2><p>Dr. Heller is an epigeneticist who pioneered methods to study the epigenetic regulation of disease genes.

    "Post Body": "<p><em>Sébastien Laverrière of</em><a href=\"https://www.syngapglobal.net/switzerland\"><em> SYNGAP1 Switzerland</em></a><em> has been part of the </em><a href=\"https://www.syngapglobal.net/\"><em>SynGap Global Network (SGN)</em></a><em> since its inception and is active in generating content. &nbsp;Sebastien’s daughter is now 15 and since the diagnosis 6 years ago, he has tried to explain to his family the very complex and intricate world of genetic and rare disease using the most accessible terms. These explanations are often converted to lay terms which are shared with the SynGAP community in multiple languages. &nbsp;We are glad to be able to repost his work here. &nbsp;This blog has been revised and updated by SRF to make it more relevant for the US audience.</em></p><p>This is a parent’s summary of<a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/gavin\"> Dr Gavin Rumbaugh</a>’s SRF Webinar from June available below. He has been researching Syngap for over 15 years.</p><p>In this webinar, Dr. Rumbaugh discusses Syngap research progress made to this date and the 3 different types of therapeutics currently being studied. These 3 therapies are being explored for a number of other rare diseases and fortunately for our Syngap community, the symptomatic specifications of SYNGAP1 suggest that we are in a good position to study one of the treatments at depth for our unique patient population.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fWzXap5jxuU?wmode=opaque&enablejsapi=1\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div></figure><p>The recent<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17093-9\"> Nature paper</a> by the team at<a href=\"https://www.stoketherapeutics.com/\"> Stoke Therapeutics</a> that Dr. Rumbaugh describes is focused on gene therapy, specifically.</p><p><strong>Technique 1: Repurpose already existing drugs on the market as well as the corresponding molecules for the Syngap patient population.</strong></p><p>Several tens of thousands of drug molecules already exist in the current treatment market but they need to now be tested one by one to possibly find one applicable to our unique patient population that works to limit or inhibit the impact of the genetic mutation (or abnormality) of Syngap. It is possible in the years to come to repurpose one of these existing drug molecules. That said, as is the case with the various anti-epileptic drugs that our children take, that different drug molecules, especially those repurposed for Syngap, may vary between Syngap patients in terms of their efficacy. While these tests and the corresponding research are long, these testing methods nevertheless exist and the delay in making this type of testing and research possible is caused only by the lack of resources (human - interested labs and scientists) and of course, funding. In essence, if adequate funding is made available, then more drug molecules can be tested at the same time and the discovery of a treatment option is made faster. Consequently, it is important to point out that these “repurposed drug molecules” have already gone through the rigorous safety approval process (by the FDA, EMA, TGA), and thus discovery could be brought to market more quickly than finding or experimenting with a brand new drug (molecule). </p><p><strong>Technique 2: Repairing the genetic mutation at the DNA level<br></strong>While the idea of repairing the actual genetic mutation of the DNA<strong> </strong>is certainly the most complete solution, it is also the most complex and unfortunately the technology is quite ready for this yet. Certain techniques such as the CRISPR method (which stands for “Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats”) do exist, in which technology is used to identify and alter individual genes or strands of DNA. However, at this point in time, the CRISPR technique has only been studied and developed to be used for a small number of mutations. While this type of method of intervention would be permanent and would in fact “repair” the genes of our Syngapians, we are challenged further in the use of such methods by the fact that each mutation of our Syngap children is different and therefore each genetic “repair” would have to be different or uniquely tailored to each type of mutation. Furthermore, this gene-altering solution also involves risks because if the repair is \"wrong\" it can have a disastrous impact. In fact, these poorly understood methods lead researchers to include in their plans for genetic alterations a kind of \"genetic emergency button\" which would make the modification inoperative in the event of a problem. Gene-altering genetic therapies that can be widely used and applied to a variety of genetic mutations will not be safely available for many years to come (some scientists say 10 to 15 years).</p><p><strong>Technique 3: The ASO technique (Antisense Oligonucleotides - gene therapy) - Empowering the healthy gene to produce more Syngap protein!<br></strong>This new technique is studied massively throughout the world. Instead of focusing on trying to repair the faulty copy of the Syngap gene, this therapeutic approach aims to make the good copy of the gene work harder. Since the Syngap1 mutation affects only one of the two chromosomes, our Syngap patients are great candidates for ASOs. &nbsp;In our Syngapiens, the SynGAP protein is needed to regulate brain functioning and is only being produced properly by the one copy of the gene - the gene that is working. With ASOs, the idea is to get the healthy gene to produce more Syngap protein than normal, basically, twice as much. The SYNGAP1 gene is the same in all humans and if we find a way to make it work more, the treatment will be generic and may eventually be the same for all of our children. Consequently and fortunately, it doesn’t matter which mutation type your Syngapian has, as this therapy is meant to work on the healthy copy of the gene irrespective of the mutation of the faulty gene.</p><p>What form does this treatment take? Currently, the vision is that the treatment would take the form of an injection every 2 to 6 months throughout the Syngapian’s life (injection into the spine). This is similar to the pain relief used during labour (Epidural), so typically very safe with a small risk of infection.</p><p>One of the risks of this method is that it could produce too much Syngap protein and it is still unknown whether that could be toxic for the brain. Researchers are looking at a mechanism to modulate the production of the protein (such as a volume control button). The technology is advancing rapidly and there are already 2 rare genetic diseases which have an existing ASO treatment (Spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy). Another challenge for SYNGAP1 is finding a way to deliver the treatment to the brain (it is not as simple as for other gene defects that can see positive effects at the blood levels - for neurological diseases, treatments have to cross the \"blood brain barrier\" to go to the right place.)</p><p>The latest paper confirms the following:</p><ul><li>Their testing in vitro (outside the body, in the lab) works on several proteins, one of which is SynGAP.</li><li>The technology they use is called TANGO and they are “reactivating” proteins that have already been created but that human body “deactivate” at first (surely because too much is produced and the body auto-regulates itself). So, instead of trying to create more Syngap protein, they use the ones that are “unused.”</li><li>The current method of treatment (injection) and the duration of the treatment (2-6 month after which you would need new injection), based on current knowledge however this may evolve with new technology and research.</li><li>The technique tested by Stoke will eventually work for thousands of different genetic mutations like Syngap1 where one gene copy is bad and the other one is available for boosting up (the therapy is the booster). This would not work on a genetic mutation on the X or Y chromosomes.</li></ul><p><strong>What will make them choose SYNGAP1 over other thousands of genetic mutations?</strong></p><ol><li>A significant, connected, communicative and motivated patient population.</li><li>High quality data describing the natural history of the Syngap population. (To join the SYNGAP1 Digital Natural History Study in the US, go to <a href=\"https://www.ciitizen.com/syngap1/\">ciitizen.com/SYNGAP1</a>)</li><li>Evidence that raising SYNGAP1 levels will resolve significant aspects of the disease.</li></ol><p><strong>We as a community can help make SYNGAP1 a more attractive target by:</strong></p><ol><li>Finding and connecting with more patients.</li><li>Participating in high quality patient registries (To join the SYNGAP1 Digital Natural History Study in the US, go to <a href=\"https://www.ciitizen.com/syngap1/\">ciitizen.com/SYNGAP1</a>).</li><li>Funding science to answer those basic science questions like ‘what happens if there is too much Syngap protein?’ (SRF is currently raising funds to support advanced research on the SynGAP protein, learn more and/or support it at <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/cobafellow\">SyngapResearchFund.org/blog/cobafellow</a>)</li></ol><p>A lot of the research has been delayed due to Covid-19 and at least 6 months were \"lost\". However, all of this research is promising and there is a great deal of research around the world in addition to that of Dr. Rumbaugh. We should not expect to have a solution tomorrow but progress is fast and visible.</p><p>An important piece of information (confirmed again by Dr. Rumbaugh) is the fact that the <strong>treatment could have a beneficial effect on both children and adults</strong>. Initially, research tended to show that the early years of brain development were the only “windows of opportunity for change”, however there is now evidence in mice that the restoration of the SYNGAP1 protein would work in adults too.</p><p>If a treatment is found, we may not be able to expect a miracle solution - but we can realistically strive for a decrease in epilepsy, reduce behavioral problems and increase understanding and communication skills. So let’s cross our fingers and <strong>support all of the researchers who are working on these projects!</strong></p><p><br></p><p>‍</p>",

They do this to take advantage of the fact that the everyone is already there, all the people they want to speak and all other investigators they want to learn about their disease.

    "Post Body": "<p><em>Caroline is the mother of Yonas an 8 year old SynGAPian. &nbsp;She recently tacked the challenge of potty training a him and has been kind enough to share her experience in this article. &nbsp;Potty training is a major challenge for all SynGAP parents, and we are so grateful she has done the work of documenting her experiance.</em></p><p><br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7a3a17875fa3ca7785a55_image-asset.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>In the beginning, potty training to us seemed like an absolutely intimidating task. In truth, we were not particularly optimistic that he could get there. Our fears were exacerbated by the following definitive question (that consumed me, fearful of this seemingly unimaginable task!): \"How can we get him to use the potty when his communication skills are so limited??”</p><p>It's not like we could tell him what is going on and he will understand. Not to mention the months at a time it would take to get him to just feel \"ok\" with sitting... are we to envision spending the next year in the bathroom? </p><p>Fear not!! All is possible. We were able to do all that and have a baby in the midst of it. In fact, we were determined to begin the process before the arrival of our fourth child (crazy as we are – we started the formal process of potty training exactly 2 weeks before our baby’s due date). But we will also say – we had help. You end up spending quite some time in the bathroom with your child and splitting that responsibility with a babysitter, a grandparent and a spouse or partner is so helpful – especially in the beginning.</p><p>We feel like we have learned tons about this process and I wanted to pass this information along in case any one of you might find it helpful! In fact, when we reflect on the past 8 months (we started about 8 months ago) - we realize that the process of teaching him to use the potty was actually quite technical and systematic. As someone who has worked in Education for quite some time, I cannot help but reflect on the very nature of the learning process and how learning unfolds, especially for him. We have come to find that when we have a better understanding of <em>how </em>he learns (or by which means), we can support him more effectively. The same was true during this phase of potty training. </p><p><strong>One of the things that I think is worth mentioning upfront are some guiding principles that truly serve as the foundation for his ability to learn or master a skill - any skill, really (surely all things SynGAP parents are too familiar with):</strong></p><ol><li>Learning is SLOW so more complex skills have to be broken down into smaller \"targets\" or objectives (I think in the ABA world this is called \"task analysis\")</li><li>Repetition, repetition, repetition!!! Yonas learns best when he is routinely asked to repeat a particular action (usually starting with \"smaller\" demands)</li><li>Yonas' definition of skill mastery includes making discrete associations with objects or experiences - &nbsp;and surprise, surprise, this happens with <em>repetition</em>! and a set routine. For example, when we have spent 2 weeks going out for a walk with him right after lunch, he will signal to us after lunch that he wants to go out because his association has become done eating lunch=walk. That is probably also the reason why the experts say that routine is so essential to the well-being and happiness of a child on the spectrum (and I never really understood that more concretely until now, I guess) - it is because the routines give rise to those associations and it is the means by which children with limited communication skills develop understanding, especially in the face of limited verbal exchanges.</li><li>Learning is best achieved through the process of “layering” in information or through a strategic build. Flooding him with too much information at once is counter-productive.</li></ol><p>Potty training him felt like a marathon, not a sprint. I wish someone could have been more clear and concrete about that with us beforehand. While people “warned” us in one way or another, we had no mental model for what that actually meant. More specifically, when I reflect back at our process, I can identify a series of “milestones” or “goals” we had to master or accomplish along the way that ultimately got him to being potty trained. It’s almost like it would have been incredibly helpful to have an IEP-esque kind of document to guide our potty training efforts. And while our ABA therapists created a task analysis for him – I am not totally sure they created smaller targets or the right kind of “milestones” at the right altitude. Based on our experience (and please take it with a grain of salt since everyone’s child and situation is different!), here are the set of goals that we ultimately achieved without spelling it out beforehand (this is based on my reflection, looking back) along with time it took to meet them:</p><h2><strong>GOALS | TIME IT TOOK FOR SKILL ACQUISITION</strong></h2><ol><li>Getting Yonas to tolerate sitting on the toilet for ~20 minutes at a time | Month 1-2</li><li>Getting Yonas to associate the potty with voiding | Month 3-4</li><li>Getting Yonas to hold his voids | Month 4-5 &nbsp;(This started developing almost simultaneously to Yonas’ understanding that toilet=void)</li><li>Getting Yonas to defecate | Month 5</li><li>Getting Yonas to tolerate the communication (in his case, pointing to a picture of the toilet) | Month 8</li><li>Getting Yonas to communicate himself, spontaneously | Not quite there yet…but almost!!</li></ol><p>While each of the above goals seem simple enough (maybe?) – it is important to point out that each goal consisted of a sub-set of steps or targets. For example, for Goal #1, we wouldn’t aim to get him to sit for us for 20 minutes from the get-go. Instead, we would start with 2 minutes in week one, 5 minutes in week two, and so forth until we worked up to 20 minutes total.</p><p>Below is a breakdown of the more concrete, individual steps we would take while working toward the broader 6 goals listed above.</p><h2><strong>GOAL #1: GETTING YONAS TO TOLERATE SITTING ON THE TOILET FOR ~20 MINUTES AT A TIME</strong></h2><p>20 minutes seems like forever – and believe me when I say that it takes a few weeks to work your way to that amount of time. The rationale for 20 minutes is that it was a reasonable enough time to “catch” Yonas voiding, especially in the very early stages. As I mention briefly above, we started with 2 minutes at a time for about a week, then increased the sittings to 5 minutes per sitting for another week or so, then 10 minutes and so forth.</p><p>If you are lucky it won’t take your child that long but you never know. Please manage your expectations here – best advice we got. Once Yonas tolerated sitting for about 20 minutes, we would take him to the bathroom every 30 minutes for about 15-20 minutes.</p><p>We were told by several people to give Yonas lots to drink but that was a real challenge since he doesn’t actually like drinking. It worked out fine, though, because after about a month or two we started to recognize patterns in his toileting habits (when he had to void) and then we began tailoring Yonas’ potty-going habits to when we thought he would need to go instead of needing to take him every 30 minutes (which, realistically, is just not sustainable even under the best of circumstances). </p><p>Very important – NO DIAPERS or PULL-UPS during this time (except at night or during transit). Yes, there will be tons of accidents along the way BUT remember the associations piece? Yonas associated the diaper with voiding in his pants and the only way to remove that association is by removing the diapers! Voiding accidents are inevitable – we kept extra underwear and pants in the bathroom for Yonas to change into and we would collect his dirty clothes into a bucket until there was enough to run a load.</p><p>Another thing I wanted to mention here is a common corrective procedure that is used as part of a number of different potty training protocol. As part of the corrective procedure, when kids have an accident – they are taken to the toilet with the soiled clothes, asked to void (even if they don’t), then taken back to the “site of the accident” in the same, soiled clothes, and then all of this is repeated twice. I am of course over simplifying here (there probably more nuance). Yonas’ teachers and therapists recommended we use this but it just didn’t work for us. Yonas would get frustrated with the back and forth to the toilet (that was the goal in part, I suppose) but I got the sense that he didn’t really understand cognitively. So we stopped that protocol and did just fine without it, pouring more time into getting Yonas to make that association between potty and voiding. </p><p>Another thing to note is that Yonas had a hard time sitting on the toilet without support given his low-muscle tone. We tried a potty seat (with step stool) to support him but we noticed he got way to comfortable and relaxed – which was also not productive. The key really was to <em>not</em> get him too comfortable. So we decided to remove the support seat and instead had to scooch him all the way to the far back of the toilet so that he would not fall in. In the first month or two, we also decided to take off his underwear, pants and shoes while sitting him on the toilet so that he could sit all the way back and spread his legs sideways for support as he got used to sitting on the potty.</p><p>Moreover, our ABA therapists recommended we read him books on the toilet or use the I-pad to get him more “comfortable” or acquainted with the notion of sitting on the potty for a while but we realized fairly quickly that those things were way too distracting for him. Yonas would very quickly associate I-pad with potty and while that was not only NOT the association we wanted to achieve, we were also worried we would eventually have to remove the I-pad even if we did get him to void with it on the toilet which felt almost like an extra step. Instead, it was much more effective to just push him through the time we needed him to sit with a firm tone and some limited singing or soothing without any true “distractions”. That is not to say Yonas didn’t tantrum – he did! In those instances we would massage his legs and his arms to calm him. That, coupled with a reward at the end of his “potty time” ended up feeling more effective for us. </p><p>When Yonas did happen to void, we would celebrate like crazy, sing songs, make him laugh and of course, reward him with chocolate or gummy bears. After a while (a month or so) he got the hang of this routine and we were able to get him to sit for 15-20 minutes at a time, as was the goal.</p><h2><strong>GOAL #2: GETTING YONAS TO ASSOCIATE THE POTTY WITH VOIDING</strong></h2><p>We noticed early on that Yonas would void only if he was completely relaxed and it was silent around him. Too many distractions were not conducive to getting him to void. Greater silence and relaxation allowed him to exclusively focus on what was going on in his body. </p><p>With time and the constant routine of going to the bathroom and sitting on the potty allowed him to slowly, but steadily (!) associate the potty with voiding. In month 2-3 we were no longer taking him every 30 minutes and instead timing it to when we knew he would typically need to void (also based on when he would drink liquids). It felt way more manageable at this point.</p><p>Consequently, in month 3-4 he had finally associated the potty with voiding. We knew because he would void within minutes of sitting on the potty!</p><h2><strong>GOAL #3: GETTING YONAS TO HOLD HIS VOIDS</strong></h2><p>This skill actually developed with time as well. Once we were able to get Yonas to know what to do on the potty (meaning, voiding once we put him on), Yonas naturally began holding his voids at around month 4-5. The more time passed, the longer he learned to hold his urine. We are now in month 9 and he can hold his voids up to 3 hours – even if he drank tons of water within that time. </p><h2><strong>GOAL #4: GETTING YONAS TO DEFECATE</strong></h2><p>Achieving this goal was a bit surprising, albeit an interesting one for us. We heard from a lot of other families and therapists that bowel movements are often trained last and even take up to 2 years to train. Even before the formal potty training began, Yonas would have his bowel movements at the same time every night. We simply started putting him on the toilet before his bath at that exact time (usually around 7pm) and he began defecating there each night (instead of in the diaper). </p><p>I think key was the fact that putting him onto the upstairs toilet right before his bath became a routine – and as we built defecating into this routine, Yonas slowly learned what he needed to do right before his bath. It is almost like the association became bowel movement in the potty=bath (the bath also served as the reinforcer since he loves water!). </p><h3>#1 TAKE-AWAY</h3><p>Increasing our awareness for Yonas’ bowel movement habits and then setting up of a routine for him to put him on the potty at or around that time.</p><h3>#2 TAKE-AWAY</h3><p>Finding some way of communicating to Yonas when he was sitting on the toilet (at that 7pm time – his usual time for defecating) that we expect him to “push” or remove his bowels. This part might be a bit graphic and apologize upfront…! Bowel movements were, at first, a bit strange and in some ways scary for Yonas. This is not uncommon with all kids who are being potty trained (I am sure you have all heard this) – kids can develop a fear of “letting go” or “losing” something. When Yonas’ bowel movements would hit the water in the toilet bowl, we would pair it with some kind of “funny” sound. I remember early on singing to him: “poop, poop poop – Yonas is doing poopy.” My husband and babysitter followed suit and after about a month or two – we could see him pushing every time we sang this little jingle. He had made the association “potty before bath = push for poop” and this seemed to work. </p><h2><strong>GOAL #5: GETTING YONAS TO TOLERATE THE COMMUNICATION (IN HIS CASE, POINTING TO A PICTURE OF THE TOILET)</strong></h2><p>For a very long time Yonas wanted nothing to do with the communication part of potty training. In the beginning, we added a picture of the potty onto his AAC device but we also prepared a laminated picture for him that we places strategically in 2 different areas (we attached it to the wall with Velcro). When we realized early on that we weren’t being successful with getting him to communicate, we decided that maybe the communication piece was too much in the beginning and we could always layer it into his learning process later on.</p><p>Looking back this was the right call. In the first few months, Yonas was busy (and probably using a lot of his mental capacity) focusing on tolerating the potty, and making association between potty and voiding, etc. Once he had mastered the first set of goals, we were able to exclusively focus on the communication piece. That said, he still isn’t using his AAC device but is using the laminated picture. It took us some time – about 1-2 months to get him comfortable with the picture, though.</p><p>Before taking him to the toilet, we would take him to where the picture was stuck to the wall, and prompt him to point to the picture. In the first 2-3 weeks it was a full physical prompt. After some time, however, we realized that he was pointing himself when we would take him to the laminated picture card and when he would point himself without a prompt – we also noticed he would void right away. To us, that signaled that he realized he had to “go” and was also becoming more comfortable with the notion of communicating just that. </p><h2><strong>GOAL #6: GETTING YONAS TO COMMUNICATE HIMSELF, SPONTANEOUSLY</strong></h2><p>We will be tackling this goal next – anticipating that we will be here for the next 3-4 months. We anticipate that getting Yonas to spontaneously communicate his needs of using the potty will require a similar strategy as before: A lot of repetition with walking him to the laminated picture card of the potty, getting him to point to the picture independent of our support – hoping that he will begin associating this picture card with “this is how I make my needs known – that I have to go.” With everything that we have put forth to make these set of skills possible for him we are feeling pretty optimistic that Yonas can get there. </p><p>There is a lot of information here and quite honestly, I didn’t anticipate writing so much! It may seem intimidating but in truth – it’s all manageable given that the various efforts don’t happen all at once – it’s really more of a one-step-at-a-time kind of a project. That said, I did want to underscore that learning in Yonas’ case feels like it always has to be a very strategic and intentional “build”. </p><p>I also want to emphasize that the above was <em>our</em> unique experience with getting Yonas to where he is today with potty training and by no means based on any type of research etc. (although, elements of it may inadvertently be – I am unsure of that, though). I am sure there are tons of potty training resources for our children out there that have been valuable and helpful to others – that just wasn’t the case with us in terms of the resources we were given or able to secure. That said, please take what I have laid out here with a grain of salt – there may be other, “more effective ways” for your own unique situation. Always just be attuned with your child’s needs and the signals they project – and then tailor your ideas to that. Sometimes, trial and error can be your best friend. And always remember – you know your child the best! Feel confident to resist even the best of “professional advice.” </p><p>Happy Training!</p><h2>POST SCRIPT - IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS</h2><p>I received a number of follow-up on my potty training post related to the question of when to best potty train. The not-so-surprising response would be \"that depends on the child\" but for us, the two big signs of readiness were as follows:</p><h3>1. GREATER AWARENESS</h3><p>Yonas started showing signs of discomfort with the diaper at around age 8 (when we decided to start training him). He would occasionally touch his diaper or tug at it and even though it was unclear whether it was the result of a true discomfort - something shifted in his awareness \"down there\". That said, he could stay in a soiled diaper for hours on end but bowel movements were more clearly uncomfortable for him. I think some sign of awareness on behalf of the child is key (but like I said, I am not convinced it HAS to be discomfort specifically).</p><h3>2. COMMUNICATION</h3><p>When we started potty training about 8 months ago we felt Yonas was ready from a communications standpoint as well. At this point, Yonas is fairly good at making his needs known - even though cognitively he functions at the age of a 1.5 year-old (in some way even younger given that he is non-verbal). However, he does avidly point to items and objects and uses his AAC device fairly well in terms of being able to \"click\" through the layers of windows (we use Touch Chat). He is also very skilled at finding Youtube videos of elevators and trains. I think the fact that he is fairly good at communicating his needs in one way or another was also an important prerequisite to being able to effectively potty train him. </p><p><br></p>",

Finding the best ICD code for a patient who has a rare disease can be a challenge.”</em> &nbsp; </p><p>The history of the ICD up to the 10th revision is laid out in a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/HistoryOfICD.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">eight page article</a> from the WHO. &nbsp;ICD-10 is what is in use in the US today. &nbsp;You may have also heard of ICD-11 and this is coming in 2022, per the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/\">WHO</a>. &nbsp;The US, however, generally takes a number of years, if not a decade to adopt a new ICD, so even though ICD-11 will be in use in the rest of the world, ICD-10 is what we should expect for the foreseeable future Stateside.</p><p><strong>Why do they matter?</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/06/how-one-number-could-change-the-lives-of-people-with-rare-disorders/564005/\">The Atlantic did a piece on ICD codes for Angelmans</a> (Q93.51) &nbsp;in 2018, please read it. &nbsp; An <a href=\"https://pompediseasenews.com/2019/02/05/icd-10-codes-really-important-to-rare-disease-patients-soon-up-for-fresh-consideration/\">article</a> about why they matter from Pompe disease (E74.02) makes the point is “<em>without a diagnostic code within the ICD-10 system, it’s very difficult to track how many people have that disease, where they are, and all the characteristics of the disease</em>”. &nbsp;As any member of the Syngap Community knows, just figuring out how many of us there are is a struggle. &nbsp;SRF began a #SyngapCensus that has been supported by the <a href=\"https://www.syngapglobal.net/\">Syngap Global Network</a> who now sponsors a <a href=\"https://www.syngap1.me/\">map</a> as well. &nbsp;These initiatives are important and consume many volunteer hours. &nbsp;Once we have an ICD code, getting an accurate current count will be much easier. &nbsp;That matters at least 1,000 cases in the US is the minimum threshold for many biotechs and drug companies to invest in a disease.</p><p>But a count is not the only reason these matter, it also facilitates health insurance reimbursement, administration, epidemiology, and research. &nbsp;Not to mention, frankly, being taken seriously. &nbsp;Almost every parent today has had an experience where a provider has learned about the disease and then had to Google it for themselves. &nbsp;Followed by awkward conversations where the practitioner says how little is known and then the parent has to point them to <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/syngap-patient-neurology-paper-five-things-every-parent-needs-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">key papers like Dr. Scheffer’s</a> to learn about the disease. &nbsp; Once Syngap has an ICD code, frankly, practitioners are more likely to realize that they need to study up.</p><p><strong>Does Syngap have one?</strong></p><p>No. &nbsp;Not yet. &nbsp;But we are close. &nbsp;Angelmans got one - Q93.51 - <a href=\"https://www.angelman.org/icd-10-code-for-angelman-syndrome/\" target=\"_blank\">in 2018</a>. CDKL5 only recently got one - G40.42 - which is described in this <a href=\"http://www.draccon.com/dracaena-report/icd10\" target=\"_blank\">excellent article</a> by <a href=\"http://www.draccon.com/ana-mingorance\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Ana Mingorance</a>. &nbsp;Similarly, Dravet aka SCN1A just got one - G40.83 as <a href=\"https://www.dravetfoundation.org/icd10-codes-for-dravet-syndrome-1-31-20/\" target=\"_blank\">announced here</a> by the Dravet Foundation. &nbsp;Angelman’s, CDKL5 &amp; Dravet are some of the best organized and well-funded rare disease organizations in existence . &nbsp;SRF looks at all of these as models we can emulate to better serve our community. &nbsp;The fact that two of them only recently got a code shows how quickly Syngap is being recognized as a significant rare disease.</p><p><strong>Are we getting one?</strong></p><p>Hopefully, soon, yes. &nbsp;There was a meeting at the CDC/online last week on March 18th. &nbsp;A number of SRF leaders were planning on going, but the Coronvavirus turned it into an online meeting and also prevented us from sharing this article sooner. &nbsp;The full agenda and proposals are available at the CDC ICD page, but the bit that really matters is repeated at the bottom of this article. &nbsp;Getting on this agenda and having a speaker present on behalf of our gene is the hardest part and this milestone was hit. &nbsp;So now there is a comment period and then the committee at CDC will meet and we can expect a decision in approximately six months.</p><p><strong>How did that happen?</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/team-profiles/hans-p-schlecht-md-science-amp-medicine-lead\" target=\"_blank\">Hans Schlecht, MD, MMSc</a>, a Syngap parent and Medical Lead for SRF has been in conversation with the CDC for months. &nbsp;His determined and ongoing advocacy for Syngap is remarkable. &nbsp;He sent an early proposal and then after further discussion with CDC he submitted another, the text of which is at the end of this article. &nbsp;A careful read of Hans’ proposal and that of the FDA will confirm that they went with one of his options, an F78 code.</p><p>In parallel, another US group had requested an ICD code and the CDC asked that both groups agree on one speaker to advocate for SynGAP. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kennedykrieger.org/patient-care/faculty-staff/constance-smith-hicks\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Connie Smith-Hicks</a> from Kennedy Krieger at Johns Hopkins kindly agreed to speak for SynGAP. &nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>What can we do now?

DISABILITY, OTHER GENETIC RELATED INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY </strong></h3><p>There are a number of specific genes which have been found to be related to intellectual disability. One of the more common such genes is SYNGAP1. There is a SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability, and this is also frequently associated with other disorders, including epilepsy and autism. Although it is considered rare, based on prevalence data, SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability is expected to affect over one million individuals worldwide. This proposal is based on two separate requests to create a code for SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability, one from the Bridge the Gap – SYNGAP1 Education and Research Foundation, and another from <strong>Hans P. Schlecht, MD, of Springfield, MA, together with the Syngap Research Fund</strong>. Also, other requests were received from Dr. Schlecht, with support from others, to create specific codes for certain other genetic related intellectual disabilities, and related genetic syndromes (those noted are not exhaustive). <br></p><p>The SYNGAP1 protein is an essential contributor to function of the postsynaptic density of neurons and critical to overall neurodevelopment. SYNGAP1 insufficiency is a rare, genetic autosomal dominant disorder resulting in reduced expression of SYNGAP1 with disabling resulting conditions. Pathogenic variants of SYNGAP1 are characterized by intellectual disability and developmental delay along with varying penetrance of autism, hypotonia, sleep disturbance, maladaptive behaviors, and epilepsy (Vlaskamp 2019). While a rare disease, prevalence data demonstrate that variants are common in nonsyndromic intellectual disability with &gt;1 million individuals predicted to be affected world-wide, making pathogenic SYNGAP1 variants more prevalent than fragile X syndrome (Hamdan 2011, Krupp 2017). </p><p>Since SYNGAP1 encephalopathy has intellectual disability as a fundamental condition—in contrast to the variable penetrance of autism and epilepsy-- and is also categorized as a nonsyndromic intellectual disability, it is proposed to classify SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability within F78 “Other intellectual disabilities,” but to also note that other associated issues which may be present should also be coded separately, such as autism and epilepsy. </p><p>Creation of a specific ICD-10-CM code for SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability, as well as one for other genetic related intellectual disability, would have a number of benefits, and the submitter believes this would aid: epidemiologic monitoring, assessment of disease-associated medical costs, retrospective studies comparing best practices, encouragement of pharmaceutical research, and recruitment of subjects for clinical trials and patient registries, as well as enabling improvement of assessment of resource requirements (Valdez 2016). </p><h3>REFERENCES </h3><ul><li>---.

Today was extra special as the The LGS foundation was hosting a <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-approval-process-drugs/cder-patient-focused-drug-development\" target=\"_blank\">Patient Focused Drug Development</a> meeting with the FDA — the full video is at the end of this article. I live streamed the meeting and listened to families share their LGS stories. From their diagnosis journey to the medications and side effects, hospital stays, injuries, the different seizure types and for some of them, the loss of a loved one to SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy).</p><p>I had to take breaks and walk away a few times as the stories were so moving and hitting too close to home. I admired their courage to stand up and share their fears, heartaches and struggles.</p><p>They inspired me to share our experience with LGS.</p><p>Ty was diagnosed with Syngap in November of 2016 at 16 months old. This diagnosis came with a high risk of developing seizures. For 2 years we monitored him carefully, had several EEGs, took videos of questionable episodes, educated ourselves about Syngap seizures and talked medication options with his team of doctors for when he would need it.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>October of 2018, at age 3.5, Ty was eating and his eyes rolled and head dropped. There was no doubt that this was a seizure. I had seen many videos of Syngap kids with these eating-triggered seizures.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"Ty taking the “Cookie Test” to see if a eating will trigger a seizure\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7af0814d9307fd16f370b_LGS%2BSyngap2.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Ty taking the “Cookie Test” to see if a eating will trigger a seizure</figcaption></figure><p>His doctor recommended that we start him on <a href=\"https://www.charlottesweb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Charlotte’s Web</a>, an over the counter CBD oil. It worked for a couple of months and we saw overall improvements with his focus and skill development.</p><p>One day we were playing in his room and mid laugh he dropped to the ground like a toy that was suddenly turned off. He had a drop seizure. Luckily he fell on carpet and didn’t hit his head too hard on the floor. We increased his dose and were good for a little while longer.</p><p>At his next neuro visit, we scheduled another EEG. The neurologist called to let us know his EEG was really bad with the slow spike and waves typical with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). His EEG was so bad that she was surprised we were not seeing more seizures. The good news was that he responded well to CBD and with the LGS diagnosis he could have access to <a href=\"https://www.epidiolex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Epidiolex</a>, the FDA approved and insurance covered CBD.</p><p>I had a hard time wrapping my head around the diagnosis and thought it was given to him mainly to access Epidiolex.</p><p>How did we go from no seizure to one of the worst epilepsy diagnosis in only a couple of months? Many syngap kids with uncontrolled seizures don’t even have this horrible diagnosis. I called her back to confirm it was not a mistake and ask other questions. She was very blunt. Ty is a textbook LGS case and at high risk of developing many different types of seizures including tonic clonic. She prescribed rescue medication that we carry with us at all times in case he has multiple seizure types in a short time or has one that lasts longer than 3 minutes. It seemed surreal since we had only noticed a few seizures and they seemed to be well controlled with CBD.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"Ty in Status\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7af0851ddf660fd26447d_LGS%2BSyngap3.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Ty in Status</figcaption></figure><p>I joined the LGS support group but still couldn’t relate to the stories I was hearing from other families.</p><p>In June, after being seizure free for a few months Ty went into <a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-epilepsy-syndromes/lennox-gastaut-syndrome-lgs/lgs-seizure-emergencies\" target=\"_blank\"><em>status epilepticus</em></a> with a partial tonic seizure. He vomited, his lips turned blue, he was completely out of it. He was given rescue meds and taken to the hospital. That day the reality of LGS really sunk in.</p><p>Today his seizures are still well controlled. We can go months without seeing any but we know that can change at any time. His brain waves are still out of control and silently messing up brain functions.</p><p>The Syngap diagnosis was difficult to digest but the LGS diagnosis was by far harder for the family. Seizures are terrifying and the unpredictability of LGS is scary. We take all the precautions we can to keep him seizure free and safe as much as we can.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"Monitoring Ty\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7af088e4332532ca89f4e_LGS%2BSyngap4.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Monitoring Ty</figcaption></figure><p>We bought a seizure monitor for night time and we are on the wait-list for a service dog.

    "Post Body": "<p>Your child has been diagnosed with a Syngap1 mutation, and you are now diving into understanding everything you can about it. With Intellectual Disability, Epilepsy, and Autism Spectrum Disorder at the forefront of your mind, you feel overwhelmed already. When scientific articles pop up with the words “Syngap” and “Schizophrenia” in the title, what’s a parent to think? We are here as a couple of parents of Syngap kids who also happen to be basic research scientists, to give you our take on how schizophrenia is involved with the Syngap gene.</p><p>First, we state that our Syngapians share a genetic feature: specifically, a new (<em>de novo</em>) mutation in one copy of the Syngap1 gene that leads to a reduction in the level of Syngap protein to half of what it should be. Decreasing the protein by half causes our Syngapians’ symptoms; any genetic disease that is caused by a reduction of half the protein is called haploinsufficiency. <strong>Bottomline: To-date, there is ZERO clinical data to suggest that haploinsufficiency of the Syngap1 protein will result in schizophrenia.</strong></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"Screenshot 2020-06-22 at 8.21.02 AM.png\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7b38fa8b972ee6cbc8ca5_Screenshot%2B2020-06-22%2Bat%2B8.21.02%2BAM.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Second, we tackle three papers you may have seen individually, and end with final thoughts.</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/30705251/?i=1&from=SYNGAP1\" target=\"_blank\">Comprehensive functional annotation of susceptibility SNPs prioritized 10 genes for schizophrenia</a> (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6355777/pdf/41398_2019_Article_398.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PDF</a>)</li></ol><p>Recently, there was a blind posting of an article about schizophrenia that lists Syngap1 as a “target gene” without any explanation of the methods, results, or implications for our Syngap population.</p><p>Reading about any association of Syngap with another condition may cause anxiety, and it may be especially high given the stigma of schizophrenia. The above paper did not study our Syngap population: as stated above, our Syngapians have a <em>de novo</em> mutation within the Syngap gene. Instead, this study looked in groups of people with and without a schizophrenia diagnosis to find markers that have been passed down through populations: markers that are linked to a schizophrenia diagnosis. Bottom line: If there are schizophrenia diagnoses in your family tree, you may be interested in this study. If not, this article is not for you.</p><p>Our Syngapians have a new (<em>de novo</em>) mutation (that their parents do not have). In rare cases, the <em>de novo</em> mutation happened in mom’s ovaries or dad’s testes. But in all cases, mom and dad do not have the new Syngap mutation in their own brain tissue. <em>de novo</em> mutations cannot be studied at the population level, because they are new, not currently present in the population.<strong> Bottomline</strong>: <strong>Reading association studies will not help you understand your Syngapian. <em>De novo</em> mutations do not show up in association studies. </strong>Fine print: if you have genome wide SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) data for your Syngapian, your genetic counselor or geneticist might have information for you from association studies.</p><p>2. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4753466/#!po=26.1364\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Syngap1: Mind the Gap</em></a><em> </em>(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4753466/pdf/fncel-10-00032.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PDF</a>)</p><p>This article has a quote that might alarm some. “Although several studies have shown the role of Syngap1 mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders, little is known about its relevance to schizophrenia… (Hamdan et al., 2009) did not find any de novo mutations, splicing or truncating, in their patients with schizophrenia.” <strong>Bottomline: The types of mutations that gave our Syngapians their diagnoses are exactly the types of mutations they did not find.</strong></p><p>3. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12598599\" target=\"_blank\">The role of synaptic GTPase-activating protein in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity.</a> (<a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/23/4/1119.full.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PDF</a>)</p><p>Let’s talk about the basic research going on with Syngap. Where in our bodies is the protein? It is expressed in a subset of neurons, in a subset of synapses, on the receiving end at the membrane where the signal is captured and relayed (called the post-synaptic density). The post-synaptic density is the largest protein machine in the human body, and while scientists know a lot about it, the amount they don’t know about it is greater. What is the Syngap protein structure? The Syngap protein has many different forms, with optional starting and ending sequences. The bulk of the protein contains domains that interact with other proteins (PH, C2) and a domain that signals (Ras-GAP). It likely has other features that are yet to be identified. When and where are the different end sequences used? And why? What proteins does Syngap directly touch, and what happens to those proteins when the amount of Syngap protein is reduced? These are questions that basic research scientists are trying to answer right now. In fact, they started wondering before any of us had a Syngapian.</p><p>After years of work, in 2003 Richard Huganir’s lab published a mouse knock-out of Syngap, where they deleted a portion of the gene. It is not clear whether this particular mutation models the mutations in our kids. Huganir’s lab and others are currently developing mouse models that exactly mimic mutations in our kids, and we look forward to hearing those results. <strong>Bottomline: If you see a “Syngap model” mouse or rat or fish, it may or may not reflect the type of mutations found in our kids. It takes a hard read to figure things out, and by that we mean that scanning journal titles does not equal education.</strong></p><p><em>So I read everything and understand I shouldn’t worry but why are scary things associated with Syngap? Isn’t Syngap enough?</em> Yes. Syngap with Intellectual Disability, Epilepsy, often Autism, and sleep issues, is enough. The confusion comes from the following: We are calling our kids Syngapians. But that is shorthand for “de novo Autosomal Dominant haploinsufficiency of Syngap1” or “new heterozygous mutation resulting in truncation of Syngap1” or many other ways you could say the same thing. But Syngap is a gene, a region of the chromosomes (Syngap-associated SNPs), and a protein. It isn’t just the name of our disease: it is the name of all of that, and that protein can be altered in different ways that may in fact be involved in autism spectrum disorders (without ID and epilepsy), bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and potentially other things too. So if you have a google alert for Syngap papers, you’ll be getting lots of interesting things to look at. Just don’t make the mistake of thinking that they all have to do with your Syngapian. Most of them won’t.</p><p><strong>The good news</strong>: The more Syngap research that happens, the more researchers that are interested, the more funded researchers studying other things who find a way to insert Syngap research into their projects, the better off our field of research will be. So while we work in the trenches, and hope for treatments, we may be seeing journal article titles that needlessly scare us. You already know your kids. You already love them.</p><p><br></p><p>‍</p>",

    "Post Body": "<p><em>Danielle Williams is a SynGAP parent leader in Australia and a member of the SynGAP Global Network.</em></p><h1><strong>Five things you need to know</strong></h1><p>An important paper which studied 57 SynGAPians was <a href=\"http://n.neurology.org/content/early/2018/12/12/WNL.0000000000006729\" target=\"_blank\">published last month in Neurology</a>. This article summarizes five things you need to know about this paper whether you are a parent, sibling, caregiver or medical professional who cares for a SynGAPian.</p><ol><li><em>The genesis story — How this paper began with a parent survey</em></li><li><em>Why this paper matters for both diagnosed &amp; undiagnosed SynGAPians</em></li><li><em>Three emerging findings validated by this &amp; other recent papers</em></li><li><em>Each parent-researcher connection matters</em></li><li><em>Highlights of the cohort of 57 SynGAPians studied</em></li></ol><h2><strong>1. THE GENESIS STORY</strong></h2><p>We received a SynGAP diagnosis for both of our daughters in February 2016. As we struggled with the diagnosis, we were hungry for information about SynGAP. We wanted information about the symptoms we were seeing and what to prepare for. With fellow SynGAP mum, Laura Ma and the support from two of the American Syngap organization founders — Rebecca Kohlhepp and Monica Weldon — we created a survey.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"DaniArticle1.jpeg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7b3b4c914f380d8941385_DaniArticle1.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Laura and I spent hours compiling <a href=\"http://bit.ly/DaniLauraSurvey\" target=\"_blank\">the report</a> which was the first source of useful Syngap patient data we had seen. It began to answer the questions that kept us up at night (if our kids weren’t already!). Questions like: how many have seizures? What types of seizures do they have? What are their triggers? Do they have behavioral issues? Do they have autism? Do they talk? Are they mobile?</p><p>In our next appointment with our neurologist <a href=\"https://www.ingridscheffer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Professor Ingrid Scheffer</a>, I proudly presented this report. Ingrid is a globally recognized epilepsy physician-researcher and singing her praises here would make this article too long. Put simply, she is one of the heroes of our medical journey.</p><p>On that day, Ingrid looked at the report &amp; rolled her eyes (her version differs). But she said, “I’ll get a team to validate this.” And that is what makes Ingrid so incredible, two years later her ‘validation’ is the largest study of SynGAPians to date in the best Journal for Neurology.</p><h2><strong>2. WHY THIS PAPER MATTERS FOR PATIENTS</strong></h2><p>For diagnosed, this paper will help parents &amp; physicians partner to understand how SynGAPians evolve and present. Unique seizures and predictable developments no longer need to be a surprise or the subject of raised eyebrows during valuable clinical conversations.</p><p>For undiagnosed patients — and we suspect there are many — the paper will be a critical tool to assist neurologists to make earlier diagnoses, in turn minimizing painful and unnecessary treatment trials for them.</p><h2><strong>3. THREE EMERGING FINDINGS VALIDATED BY THIS &amp; OTHER RECENT PAPERS</strong></h2><p>This paper makes many important points but here are three that SynGAP parents and their physicians should be aware of.</p><p>First, it identifies a new seizure type: eyelid flutters followed by a drop (eyelid myoclonia followed by myoclonic-atonic seizures). It also validates two other recent SynGAP publications:</p><p>Second, it reaffirms the connection between SynGAP and sensory processing issues which was also discussed in November in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0268-0?WT.feed_name=subjects_neuroscience#Abs1\" target=\"_blank\">SYNGAP1 heterozygosity disrupts sensory processing by reducing touch-related activity within somatosensory cortex circuits</a>. Michaelson et. al. Nature Neuroscience, 2018.</p><p>Third, it notes the correlation between Syngap and eating as a seizure trigger which is the focus of a concurrent paper <a href=\"https://www.seizure-journal.com/article/S1059-1311(18)30466-7/abstract\" target=\"_blank\">Chewing induced reflex seizures („eating epilepsy“) and eye closure sensitivity as a common feature in pediatric patients with SYNGAP1 mutations: review of literature and report of 8 cases</a> by Stülpnagel et. al. Seizure, 2018</p><h2><strong>4. EACH PARENT-RESEARCH CONNECTION MATTERS</strong></h2><p>I’m grateful to be involved with Prof. Scheffer and her team on this project. The two young doctors who drove the project Dr Ben Shaw and Dr Danique Vlaskamp, are incredible people. Danique received her PhDs along the way!</p><p>We encourage every parent to connect with researchers at every opportunity. If you are visiting their city, ask if you can come to their labs, with your child/patient. Let them know how much their work matters and encourage them to keep going. As this study shows, their work requires our input and our kids require their dedication and talent.</p><p>All parties benefit when great doctors believe in the power of driven parents &amp; those parents harness their collective skills.</p><h2><strong>5. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE COHORT OF 57 SYNGAPIANS STUDIED</strong></h2><p>Please read this paper. It is full of important information about SynGAP. Please print it out and take it to all your doctors and therapists. But just to give you a taste, to follow are some interesting statistics about the 57 patients reviewed.</p><ul><li>57 patients (53% male, median age 8 years)</li><li>56 had epilepsy: generalized in 55, with focal seizures in seven and infantile spasms in one.</li><li>Median seizure onset age was 2 years.</li><li>A new type of drop attack was identified comprising eyelid myoclonia (eyelid flutters) evolving to a myoclonic- atonic (jerk drop) for 5 patients and atonic (drop) seizures in another 8.</li><li>65% had eyelid flutters with absences (eyelid myoclonia with absences)</li><li>25% had seizures triggered by eating</li><li>Eating problems, with poor intake or gorging, were also found in more than half of the cohort</li><li>55 patients had intellectual disability (ID). Moderate to severe in 50.</li><li>73% had behavioural problems</li><li>72% had a high pain threshold</li><li>This finding of a high pain threshold may suggest a role for SYNGAP1 in sensory processing</li><li>68% had eating problems including oral aversion</li><li>67% had hypotonia (low muscle tone)</li><li>62% had sleeping problems</li><li>54% have an autism diagnosis</li><li>51% have gait abnormalities or ataxia (lack of muscle control / coordination of voluntary movements)</li><li>Developmental plateauing or regression occurred with the onset of seizures in 56 patients</li><li>In 8 patients, developmental regression occurred two months to &gt;3 years prior to the recognition of seizures. Diagnosis of seizures in SYNGAP1 is therefore crucial as appropriate management may potentially improve outcome.</li><li>SYNGAP1 mutations cause a generalized DEE with a distinctive syndrome combining epilepsy with eyelid myoclonia and myoclonic-atonic seizures, and predilection to seizures triggered when eating.</li><li>Loss-of-function of SYNGAP1 has major consequences for neuronal homeostasis and development, which are crucial for learning and memory.</li><li>A milder outcome of SYNGAP1 DEE was observed significantly more frequently in patients with mutations in exons 1–4, compared with those with mutations in exons 5–19.</li><li>In line with this, Mignot et al. also showed that patients with mutations in exon 4–5 were more pharmaco sensitive compared to those with mutations in exon 6–19</li><li>Recognition of seizures in the context of SYNGAP1 can be challenging, but is crucial to optimising anti-epileptic therapy and improving long term outcome.</li></ul><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><a href=\"https://n.neurology.org/content/neurology/early/2018/12/12/WNL.0000000000006729.full.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><div><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-12-27 at 10.09.03 PM.png\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7b3b458c8367fee6bea35_Screen%2BShot%2B2019-12-27%2Bat%2B10.09.03%2BPM.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></a></figure><p><br></p><p>‍</p>",

His laboratory focuses on how synaptic connection and neural circuitry contribute to memory, cognition, and behavioral adaptations; more specifically, in comprehension of the genetic mechanism of neurodevelopmental disorders. The Rumbaugh laboratory has been actively pursuing therapeutic pathways to recover disrupting synaptic function and circuit connectivity caused by SynGap 1 mutation.</p><p>Dr. Rumbaugh has authored <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Rumbaugh%20G%5BAuthor%5D%20syngap1\" target=\"_blank\">at least a dozen papers</a> on Syngap to date, including one that gives us reason to believe that our patients can be helped by a theraputic. &nbsp;This is better explained in <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-04/sri-gri042619.php\" target=\"_blank\">this articles from AAAS</a>.</p><p>Dr. Gavin Rumbaugh worked with <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/huganir\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Rick Hunganir</a> during his postdoctoral years when he studied the basic science of how SynGAP protein regulates synaptic function. At the time, SynGAP 1 was a gene, but rare SynGAP 1 related disorders have not been identified in human patients. &nbsp;He experienced a “powerful change in his career” after meeting his first SynGAP1 patient and devoted his time on SynGAP translational research in his own laboratory to discover pharmaco-therapeutic for his SynGAP patients from then on. &nbsp;</p><p>SynGAP Research Fund has the privilege to gain some insights of what Dr. Gavin is working on. His interview below:</p><p><strong>1. Can you tell us a little about you and how did you get interested in SynGAP mutation in the first place?</strong></p><p>I studied Syngap1 function as a postdoc in an effort to understand how it generally regulated synapse function. Very basic science. The year I started my own lab, <a href=\"https://neurosciences.umontreal.ca/recherche/les-chercheurs/jacques-l-michaud/\" target=\"_blank\">Michaud</a>’s group identified the original Syngap1 patients. Overnight, I re-directed my lab to understand how the brain is impacted by Syngap1 haploinsufficiency. We went on to publish the original Syngap1 mouse modeling studies.</p><p> <br><strong>2. What are the highlights of your research recently?</strong></p><p>We are working hard on two fronts. </p><p>First, using screening methods, we are trying to find drug-like small molecules that regulate SynGAP protein expression in neurons expressing Syngap1 haploinsufficiency. These studies will hopefully identify new drugable pathways to regulate SynGAP expression in patients. I call these studies searching for “Plan B” and “Plan C”, with ASOs being plan A! &nbsp;(See section 3 of <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/pathways-to-a-cure-for-syngap1\" target=\"_blank\">this blog</a> for more on ASOs)</p><p>Second, we are using animal models to understand the origins of abnormal behaviors common to Syngapians. We want to understand how the Syngap1 haploinsufficient brain functions to produce behaviors that look like high pain threshold (lack of defensive behaviors), risky behaviors (moving/walking into dangerous situations), and tantrums/challenging behavior (triggered aggressive behaviors). We suspect that these behaviors are generated by brain mechanisms that are unrelated to seizure. In order to find effective treatments for the difficult behaviors, we need to first understand the biological origins. &nbsp;</p><p><strong><br> 3. What are the obstacles if any with your research?</strong></p><p>Time and money. Never enough of either. &nbsp;(Dr. Rumbaugh is an <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/grants\" target=\"_blank\">SRF grantee</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nereallamosas/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Llamosas</a> as an SRF Fellow.)<br><br></p><p><strong>4. &nbsp;What are you most excited relates to SynGAP research in the near future?</strong></p><p>That more and more labs are starting to study Syngap1. We need a broad and interactive scientific community if we are going to find safe and effective therapies for Syngapians. &nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HBJGdbUPUQc?wmode=opaque&enablejsapi=1\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div></figure><p>Gavin giving a presentation at Scripps in 2019 regarding his work on SynGAP.</p><p>‍</p>",

He is also the Chair of the <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/sab\" target=\"_blank\">SRF Scientific Advisory Board</a>. &nbsp;He was inquisitive in how the nervous system works since he was in second grade. In high school, he attempted to replicate an experiment to determine the role of protein synthesis in learning and memory he had read about on <em>Scientific American. </em>He was able to train his experimental subjects --Goldfish to escape light to avoid getting electrical shocks, but unable to obtain Puromycin, an antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis to use on his Goldfish to complete the remaining part of the experiment because of his young age.</p><p>Dr. Huganir continues to pursue his interest in science in college and graduate school. In his early years of research, he studied synaptic transmission on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, but his ultimate interest is in the synaptic transmission, function, and plasticity in the central nervous system. After he became an associate professor at Johns Hopkin in 1988, his research began to shift to excitatory and inhibitory receptors in the central nervous system, such GABA receptors and Glutamate receptors, more specifically NMDA and AMPA receptors. SynGAP is then discovered as a protein that is part of the NMDA receptor complex that modulates function of the excitatory synapses.</p><p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9581761/\" target=\"_blank\">He identified SynGAP as a gene in 1998 that encodes for proteins involved in synaptic function</a> in the brain. Since then, he discovered how SynGAP and its different isoforms regulate synaptic plasticity and learning in the brain. His laboratory focuses on studying the molecular mechanism of various neurotransmitters and receptors and how they work intricately in synaptic transmission. The highlights of research on the SynGAP 1 gene is summarized in Dr. Huganir’s latest review: <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32075947/\" target=\"_blank\">Twenty years of SynGAP research: From Synapses to Cognition</a>. SynGAP protein’s structure, expression, localization, biochemical function and its role in synaptic plasticity, intellectual deficit, its correlation to autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia were discussed.</p><p>Dr. Huganir and his team continue to study the basic biology of SynGAP but also examine how human mutations in SynGAP regulate physiology and behavior by generating mouse models of SynGAP related disorders. Furthermore, his laboratory is actively working on potential therapeutic approaches to treat SynGAP related disorders. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/grants\" target=\"_blank\">One of SRF’s first and largest grants is to the Huganir lab</a>. Members of SynGAP Research Fund are honored to interview a pioneer in SynGAP research.<br><br><strong>1. Can you tell us a little about you and how did you get interested in SynGAP mutation in the first place?</strong></p><p>I have been interested in the mechanisms of learning memory for my whole career. My lab has studied how synapses in the brain work and how they are changed during learning to encode memories. We have identified many proteins and genes that are critical for synapse function and learning and memory. My lab identified SynGAP in 1998 as a protein involved in synapse function in the brain and with other labs across the world have shown over the years that it is critical for learning in mice.</p><p> <br><strong>2. What are the highlights of your research recently?</strong></p><p>Identifying how SynGAP is regulated by learning and discovering the details of how SynGAP regulates synapse function. In the early 2000s we deleted the SynGAP gene in mice and found that mice having 50% of SynGAP had severe deficits in synapse function. These mice also have learning and memory deficits, are hyperactive, have repetitive behaviors and also have epilepsy. Remarkably this mouse is now an animal model for kids with SynGAP mutations. We have begun to make mice that have human mutations to better model how mutations in SynGAP regulate synapses and behavior.</p><p><strong><br> 3. What are the obstacles if any with your research?</strong></p><p>I have a pretty big lab and we work on many projects in the lab related to learning and memory in addition to our SynGAP projects. Funding a big lab like this is always a challenge and we have to continuously write grants to keep the lab going.<br></p><p><strong>4. &nbsp;What are you most excited relates to SynGAP research in the near future?</strong></p><p>We are continuing to study the basic biology of SynGAP but also examining how human mutations in SynGAP regulate physiology and behavior by generating mouse models of SynGAP related disorders. As we think that most SynGAP mutations in humans with SynGAP related disorders decrease SynGAP levels in the brain we are working on methods to increase SynGAP levels or activity. These types of studies may provide therapeutic approaches to treat SynGAP related disorders.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"Members of the Huganir Lab\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7a480a8b972dd0fbc47f0_Screenshot%252B2020-04-02%252Bat%252B7.39.25%252BPM.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Members of the Huganir Lab</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p>",

    "Post Body": "<p><em>How one family improved sleep &amp; reduced seizures for a SynGAPian with a small surgery indicated by a sleep study. This article is the opinion of one family who has no medical training and this is not medical advice. But the experience is well worth reflecting on. The punchline is this, if your child is SynGAP affected and struggles with sleep, please talk to your ENT/medical team about having a sleep study.</em></p><p>After diagnosis with SynGAP we found ourselves deep in conversation about AEDs and therapies. It took a few visits to our doctor before we said “Our biggest challenge is sleep, it’s getting worse.” So we were referred for &amp; did a sleep study, aka a “PSG”. (After reading this <a href=\"https://www.littlestwarrior.com/blogs/news/what-to-expect-at-a-sleep-study\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a> from LittlestWarrior, we realize we were lucky that it was so easy to get the referral!)<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"sleep 1.jpeg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7b3eb1c439f32c5241b9f_sleep%2B1.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><blockquote><em>A </em><strong><em>Polysomnogram (PSG) </em></strong><em>is an overnight sleep study that records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, body movement, and more. -</em><a href=\"https://www.alaskasleep.com/blog/what-to-expect-in-lab-sleep-study-polysomnography\" target=\"_blank\"><em>ASC</em></a></blockquote><p>When we say sleep was a challenge, we aren’t kidding. Once we got him to sleep — which was a challenge we could only meet with total exhaustion or some mind of melatonin — things got really interesting. Our son would toss and turn all night long and wake up at odd hours. Every night.</p><p>Some parents in the community swear by a tincture that combines melatonin to get the child to sleep and valerian root with some other ingredients to keep them asleep. We started using this — still do — and it does help, but it did not improve the quality of sleep, the tossing and turning. He would always end up with his head cocked up in the oddest position. Only now do we understand why.<br><br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"sleep 2.jpeg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7b3eb32cba4149571453e_sleep%2B2.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>The sleep study was no joke either. It’s an EEG plus, all those wires on the head, plus pulse, oxygen, sensors on the legs, chest and nose. Both times I was incredulous we would last more than an hour. It’s amazing what tape and bandages can do. More to point, our kids are resilient.</p><p>The first study came back with two numbers: 83% and 8. Oxygen saturation was 83% and the AHI was over 8. Normal sleeping oxygen <a href=\"https://www.sleeprenewal.co.za/oxygen-levels\" target=\"_blank\">should be</a> in the mid 90s, so 83% was not enough, and as a result the brain woke the body up to move a bit and take a breath. How often? AHI is answer to that question. And in his case it was over 8 times an hour. That’s not good for any brain, especially one already affected by a SynGAP mutation. A AHI over 5 is <a href=\"http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/sleep-apnea/diagnosing-osa/understanding-results\" target=\"_blank\">classified</a> as some level of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).</p><blockquote><em>The most common cause of OSA in children is enlarged tonsils and adenoids (large relative to the child’s airway) that block the airway and obstruct breathing during sleep. During the daytime, muscles in the head and neck more easily keep the airway passages open. During sleep, muscle tone decreases, allowing tissue to come closer together and these large tonsils and adenoids tend to block the airway for periods of time. -</em><a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14312-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cleveland Clinic</em></a></blockquote><p>The Clinic further notes other causes of OSA. They include ‘low muscle tone (hypotonia, as in neuromuscular diseases)’ on their list. As parents of SynGAPians well know, our children have low tone. Or as NORD <a href=\"https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/syngap1-related-nsid/\" target=\"_blank\">writes</a>,</p><blockquote><em>Children with SYNGAP1-related NSID present with mild hypotonia (low muscle tone) and global developmental delay at the end of the first year or during the second year of life.</em></blockquote><p>This makes sense, our kids lack tone so the muscles relax more than they would in neurotypical kids and the airway gets blocked, oxygen drops and sleep is interrupted. It took us a while to figure this out, we just thought he was having more seizures.</p><p>But what if instead of the disturbed sleep being a result of seizures, it was causing them? (See this <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1176369/\" target=\"_blank\">lit review</a> exploring the relationship between sleep and seizures.)</p><p>If that is true, then there is a way to help. Get those tonsils out, clear the path for the air to get in. This is what we did and, after doing another PSG, the results are in 91 and 3.3, which is much better than 83 and 8. Anecdotally, our son sleeps better, tosses and turns much less and doesn’t wind up with a hyperextended neck every night.</p><p>Things are better, not fixed. But we’ll take what we can get. He still wakes up too early. We still use the melatonin and valerian root tincture, but now sleep is far better.</p><p>We even wonder if we are seeing less absence seizures. Could this be true? According to this <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22633630\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> from 2012 there seems to be a link. They looked at 27 children (median age 5) with epilepsy and obstructive sleep apnea.</p><blockquote><em>Three months after surgery, 10 (37%) patients became seizure-free, three (11%) demonstrated &gt;50% seizure-reduction, and six (22%) exhibited an amelioration of seizure frequency. Two (7%) demonstrated unchanged seizure-frequency, and six (22%) manifested a worsening of seizure frequency.</em></blockquote><p>So there you have it, our learning in a nutshell. If you have a child with SynGAP you need more to do like you need a hole in the head. So we’re sorry, but looking back we are so glad we did this. On the bright side, it’s nice to have something we can do for our child that give measurable results.</p><p>Good luck.<br><br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\"><div><img alt=\"sleep 3.jpeg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7b3eb1fb3583075ddf2f4_sleep%2B3.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>‍</p>",

Today, the count stands at<strong> 762 patients</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Is this a perfect count? No. Indeed, there may be a small margin of error, although we tend err on the side of caution and don’t count someone if we’re unsure (if anything we’re undercounting). However, this number matters and there’s no one else counting for us. It’s up to us as SYNGAP1 patient advocacy groups to make sure our loved ones are fairly represented. Counting matters because companies invest in treatments based on numbers of patients diagnosed and how fast they are being found. We also need to know who’s out there so we can recruit into our natural history study with <a href=\"https://www.ciitizen.com/syngap1\">Ciitizen</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>By the end of the year 2019, <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/syngapcensus-for-2019\">we were up to 484</a>;&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/4q20\">year end 2020, 705</a>. At the end of the first quarter of 2021 we're now standing at <strong>762</strong>. Linear progression but progression nonetheless. At this rate we should have between 900 and 1000 patients diagnosed by the end of 2021.</p><p>We urge everyone to <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/contact-us\">reach out to SRF</a> or any of our partners in <a href=\"https://www.syngapglobal.net\">SGN</a> and make sure we have you counted. If your family member with SYNGAP1 is currently resident in any country where you can obtain medical records in English, we encourage you to participate in <a href=\"http://www.ciitizen.com/syngap1\">Ciitizen</a>, SRF's patient registry and the largest SYNGAP1 natural history study ever conducted. If you’re in a Spanish speaking country, please also get in touch because we can organize the translation of your medical records into English.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, please put a pin on the SGN <a href=\"https://www.syngap1.me/\">SynGAP Map</a> to see which families might be close to you.</p><h2>WHERE DID WE FIND MORE PATIENTS?</h2><p>The summary census data is available in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oJwMysR2wyTxe91zLlKJglNa0NySPxkBF0PRiV6mBmM/edit?usp=sharing\">this Google Sheet</a>. In Q1 we added an additional 12 patients in the USA and 2 in the UK. The other top stories of this quarter were: 1) an additional 8 diagnosed patients found in Poland due to the outreach of SYNGAP1 parent and SRF volunteer Beata Tarasiuk - thank you Beata! 2) Turkey entered the SYNGAP1 stage with 6 new patients identified; 3) Brazil has a growing number of patients: now at 14&nbsp; - thank you Keli! We also found patients in five other new countries: Argentina, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Qatar, Ukraine. Very encouraging to see new diagnoses and connections strengthening with these countries.&nbsp;</p><h2>THESE NUMBERS ARE STILL TOO LOW</h2><p>We know there are many more undiagnosed patients out there. One of the most powerful things we can do as parents and caregivers is to share our loved one’s diagnosis story. This is really important, especially&nbsp; if you’re part of a community that is not well represented in the data (SYNGAP1 diagnoses are mainly comprised of caucasian children). It’s important to explain what learning about SYNGAP1 has meant for families because genetic testing is not always considered necessary, particularly if a person is older or has a milder presentation of the disorder. SRF and SGN has a wide network of doctors, researchers, genetic counselors and rare disease advocacy partners. Sharing your story via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/syngapfund/\">Warrior Wednesday</a> is a great way to get your voice heard by all of them. If you’re part of an under-represented community or live in a country with a low diagnosis rate please get in touch with us so we can help tell your story!&nbsp;<br></p>",

If you love someone with a Syngap1 diagnosis, you know enough already. Caring for you Syngapian does not require you to have deep knowledge about the DNA alteration and resulting protein change in Syngap1. But if you are curious, and want to understand the information in your genetic report, it can be frustrating to read because genetic reports are full of jargon. Your primary source for information is your genetic counselor and geneticist. If you listened to them, and still have questions, this document might help.</p><p>We will go over several different types of Syngap1 findings to explain information in your genetic report. You may read this entire document, but an easier strategy is to scan the <strong>nomenclature in bold</strong> in the four examples below for something similar to the finding in your report. The numbers will most likely be different, but the explanation of the letters and symbols might help you.</p><p>The genetic test reads and reports on changes in the DNA (inherited, stable material in every cell, made of bases, with positions like 6p21.32). Reading the DNA change is often not helpful by itself, because no one knows all the DNA locations and their significance. The protein change (or RNA change, if there is not a protein listed) is the most straightforward way to understand the effect of the mutation. First, we must say that this is a PREDICTED protein change. Based on what is known about how DNA encodes proteins, predicted protein information is usually accurate.</p><p>The Syngap1 gene codes for the Syngap1 protein, which is 1,343 amino acids long. Mutations in the Syngap1 DNA that change or delete amino acids from the protein, or that change the amount of protein found in cells, may cause symptoms. When an RNA change only is described, it usually creates a splice change. A splice mutation would result in incorrect RNA editing, resulting in altered protein or in less protein produced. For all the patients diagnosed with Syngap1, the working hypothesis is that a mutation “breaks” one copy of the Syngap1 gene, and the amount of protein coming from the unbroken copy is not enough to work properly. So the<strong> </strong>symptoms seen are thought to be from not enough Syngap1 protein. When one working copy of a gene is not enough to carry out the role that both copies typically carry out, it is called “haploinsufficiency<strong>”</strong>.</p><p>Each of the four examples below came from a genetic report. The words in parenthesis are to help explain the report, as are the paragraphs after the report information.</p><h2><strong>EXAMPLE 1: EXOMENEXT (20,000 EXOMES) FROM AMBRY GENETICS</strong></h2><p><em>Gene Symbol</em>: SYNGAP1 (This is our gene.)</p><p><em>Gene Inheritance</em>: Autosomal (on Chromosome 1–22, not X or Y)</p><p><em>Dominant </em>(one copy of the mutation causes symptoms)</p><p><em>Characterized/Novel</em>: Characterized (means the gene has been studied, not the exact mutation described in this report)</p><p><em>Protein Change</em>: <strong>p. R234Vfs*18</strong> This will be discussed below</p><p><em>Nucleotide Change</em>: 698_699dupGT The bases GT at position 698, 699 are duplicated. If three bases are inserted, one new amino acid is inserted in the protein. If one or two bases are inserted (or any number not divisible by three), the code is disrupted at the insertion and a frameshift occurs. The result of the frameshift is the wrong amino acids and a stop.</p><p><em>Genotype</em>: Heterozygous (only one of the two copies of the Syngap1 gene is</p><p>broken) <em>de novo</em> (new mutation, not found in mom or dad)</p><p><em>Alteration type</em>: Frameshift (fs) (the instructions contain a mistake that shifts the RNA instructions into the wrong frame for coding)</p><p><em>Alteration Classification</em>: Pathogenic (causes the symptoms)</p><p><em>Gene Overlap</em>: Positive (this genetic alteration is in the gene, not just near it)</p><p><strong>p.R234Vfs*18</strong> This is a dense shorthand for the following: In the predicted protein (p.) the amino acid called Arginine (R) at position 234 has been changed to a Valine (V). In addition there is a frameshift (fs) that causes 18 new and different amino acids to be attached to the protein at that point, ending in a stop (*). This ends the dense information above. But, we also know the following:</p><p>The full-length Syngap protein is 1343 amino acids. The shortened predicted protein may or may not be stable (probably not) and results in haploinsufficiency. That is, there is one good copy of the Syngap gene, and that is not enough to have full function. So this mutation explains the symptoms seen.</p><h2><strong>EXAMPLE 2: COURTAGEN EPISEEK (EPILEPSY-ASSOCIATED GENES)</strong></h2><p><em>Gene</em>: SYNGAP1</p><p><em>Amino acid change</em>: <strong>p.Cys599Trp</strong></p><p><em>Zygosity</em>: Heterozygous (only one of the two copies of the Syngap1 gene is broken)</p><p><em>Mode of Inheritance</em>: Autosomal (on Chromosome 1–22, not X or Y) Dominant (one copy of the mutation causes symptoms)</p><p><em>Disease association</em>: ADID5 (Autosomal Dominant Intellectual Disability 5) (which maps to Syngap1)</p><p><em>Variant inheritance</em>: <em>de novo</em> (not present in mom or dad)</p><p><strong>p.Cys599Trp</strong>: In the predicted protein (p.) the amino acid at position 599 is usually a Cysteine (Cys) and has been changed to a Tryptophan (Trp).</p><p>Incidentally, by looking at alignments of Syngap proteins from different species, we know that Position 599 is within a domain that is highly conserved in all RasGAP domains, and mouse and zebrafish Syngap proteins have an evolutionary conservation of that Cysteine. This small alteration may cause all the symptoms seen.</p><h2><strong>EXAMPLE 3: THE CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL OF PHILADELPHIA (CHOP) MEDICAL EXOME REPORT</strong></h2><p>(No Predicted Protein stated)</p><p><em>Gene</em>: SYNGAP1</p><p><em>Variant</em>: <strong>c.190–2A&gt;G</strong> See Below</p><p><em>Variant Classification</em>: Pathogenic (causes the symptoms seen)</p><p><em>Zygosity</em>: Heterozygous (only one of the two copies of the Syngap1 gene is</p><p>broken)</p><p><em>Disease Info</em>: Intellectual Disability and Epilepsy</p><p><em>Inheritance</em>: A Autosomal (on Chromosome 1–22, not X or Y) D Dominant (one copy of the mutation causes symptoms)</p><p><em>Parental Origin</em>: <em>de novo</em> (not from either parent, a new mutation)</p><p><strong>c.190–2A&gt;G</strong> “A heterozygous <em>de novo</em> pathogenic variant was identified in the consensus splicing site at intron 2 of the SYNGAP1 gene.”</p><p><em>Explanation</em>: Our DNA encodes genes in small interrupted segments. The segments that contain protein coding information are called exons. The segments that interrupt are called introns. After RNA is made from the DNA, the RNA is processed or edited to remove the introns. The process of removing introns requires “consensus splicing site” information. In this patient, the A at the minus 2 position from 190 (thus in the intron, not at 188 in the exon) is changed to a G. This means that the intron is not spliced out correctly. When this happens, either the RNA is unstable and degraded (leading to haploinsufficiency) or it might try to make protein, be too short and not work or be an unstable protein (leading to haploinsufficiency). So this mutation explains the symptoms seen.</p><h2><strong>EXAMPLE 4: CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL OF PHILADELPHIA</strong></h2><p><em>Disease</em>: Intellectual Disability</p><p><em>Inheritance</em>: AD: A: Autosomal (on Chromosome 1–22, not X or Y) D: Dominant (one copy of the mutation causes symptoms)</p><p><em>Gene (OMIM*)</em>: Syngap1 Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man</p><p><a href=\"https://www.omim.org/entry/603384\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.omim.org/entry/603384</a></p><p><em>Variant</em>: c.1507C&gt;T <strong>p.Q503*</strong> see below</p><p><em>Zygosity</em>: Heterozygous (only one of the two copies of the Syngap1 gene is broken)</p><p><em>Classification</em>: Pathogenic (causes the symptoms)</p><p><em>Parental Origin</em>: <em>de novo</em></p><p><em>Reference/Comments</em>: Sanger confirmed (means a second sequencing method was used to confirm)</p><p><strong>p.Q503* </strong>At position 503 there is usually a Glutamine (Q), it is changed to a stop (*) and the protein ends early (is truncated).</p><p>When a protein is truncated, it may or may not be produced (more research would need to be done to know). If the shortened protein is produced, it doesn’t work properly. If the shortened protein is not produced, the amount of protein from the unbroken copy is not enough. The result in either case is not enough protein from the copy that isn’t broken, which is called haploinsufficiency.</p><p>From the report: “A <em>de novo</em> heterozygous pathogenic variant was identified in exon 9 of the SYNGAP1 gene.”</p><p>“This nonsense variant occurs in exon 9 out of 19 exons. The variant … is predicted to result in a loss of function either through truncations of the endcoded protein or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. A different truncating variant in exon9 has also been reported in the ClinVar database as pathogenic by GeneDx.”</p><h2><strong>FINAL THOUGHTS:</strong></h2><p>Variation of Uncertain Significance: Why is there uncertainty? Because scientists don’t know everything yet!</p><p>How could “uncertain” change to “likely pathogenic”? When similar variants are found with similar symptoms, certainty grows.</p><p>Likely Pathogenic: what if I don’t know if my child has Syngap?

Coba and Quadrato, we reviewed their proposal with our Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) who is supportive of this project. &nbsp;We are pleased to share this with the parent community, and request your support for this initiative. &nbsp;</p><p>100% of donations received by SRF go to research, as the founders cover all overheads. &nbsp;Please read on and learn about why we are excited about this, and then consider donating and sharing this project with your networks! &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who is Dr. Marcelo Coba &amp; how did he become interested in Syngap?</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/marcelo-pablo-coba/\" target=\"_blank\">Marcelo Coba, PhD</a>, is an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at the <a href=\"https://www.keckmedicine.org/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Southern California’s (USC) Keck School of Medicine</a>. His <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/39566821_Marcelo_P_Coba\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> focuses on systems biology, synaptic signaling complexes, protein phosphorylation, and psychiatric disorders, along with other SynGAP1 relevant topics. </p><p>Dr. Coba’s impressive educational background includes a Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) and postdoctoral work in Neuroscience. His education sets him apart and aligns well with SynGAP patients’ needs. He already holds an RO1 grant, which is the pinnacle of science funding in the US. His team has been studying Syngap for some years, and is an exciting addition to the strong list of researchers in the Syngap community.</p><p><a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/team-profiles/hans-p-schlecht-md-science-amp-medicine-lead\" target=\"_blank\">Hans Schlecht</a>, MD--an infectious disease doctor, a fellow SynGAP parent, and the Science and Medicine Lead on the SRF team--is the reason SRF is connected with Dr. Coba. &nbsp;Upon receiving his son’s diagnosis, Hans was eager to see what science was currently being conducted to learn more about SynGAP1 mutations, with the hope of finding a treatment. In 2017, he searched SynGAP1 as a keyword in the <a href=\"https://projectreporter.nih.gov/reporter.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">NIH Reporter</a>. His search yielded the names of the researchers that mention the protein or mutation in their work. Through his networking, Dr. Schlecht scheduled a phone call with Dr. Coba. He was immediately impressed by Dr. Coba’s willingness to engage and to be a partner with a common goal. </p><p>Reflecting on Dr. Coba, Hans said “<em>A doctor is assessed on the three As: Affable, Available &amp; Able. Coba is all of these. &nbsp;He is easy to talk to, he replies to calls and emails and he’s a capable scientist.</em>” </p><p>Early on, Dr. Coba offered to meet Hans when he was out for a meeting with the Broad. &nbsp;Hans drove out and they spent a few hours together. &nbsp;Since then Dr. Coba has met with other SRF leaders at Global Genes in 2018 and he attended our <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/1st-roundtable\" target=\"_blank\">1st Roundtable</a> at AES last year. </p><p><a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/team-profiles/mike-graglia\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Graglia</a>, Managing Director of SRF, said about Dr. Coba that he “<em>is simply fascinated by the science and SynGap. He has spent hours letting us pick his brain and ask questions about his papers. Maybe it is his training as a pharmacist, but he is really easy to work with and talk to. I’m thrilled to think that SRF is supporting his work.</em>”</p><p><strong>What’s the Science?</strong> </p><p>Drs. Giorgia Quadrato and Marcelo Coba are using patient-derived human brain organoids generated from stem cells. Organoids are complex, 3D structures that exhibit human-specific qualities much more accurately than the alternative research strategy, mouse models. They can be thought of as miniature brains in test tubes that react in ways very similar to actual human brains, thereby allowing Dr. Coba and Dr. Quadrato’s teams to conduct “clinical trials” of potential treatments in petri dishes quickly and safely. </p><p><strong>How Do We Make This Happen? </strong></p><p>By supporting the Syngap Research Fund’s commitment of $50,000 grant. You will be supporting half of the purchase cost to specialized equipment, which will significantly accelerate their research into developmental disabilities. The balance of the cost will be paid by the Keck School of Medicine</p><p>Together we can help Drs. Coba and Quadrato increase scientific knowledge about developmental disabilities caused by the SNYGAP1 mutation and ultimately develop life-changing treatments. </p><p><strong>Please help SRF advance Syngap Research for Rare Disease Week</strong></p><p>Please donate to help SRF support USC in securing and maintaining this cutting-edge technology. Our hope is to foster this work so scientists and researchers like Drs. Coba and Quadrato are encouraged to mentor other minds and thus have a multiplicative effect on science! </p><p><a href=\"https://charity.gofundme.com/syngap-organoid\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Donate to our Go Fund Me</strong></a> or if you prefer to send a check, please use the donate button above for details and put “Organoid” in the memo line.</p><ul><li><br></li></ul><p>‍</p>",

    "Post Body": "<p>‍<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/\" target=\"_blank\">ClinVar</a> is a freely accessible, public archive of reports of the relationships among human genetic variations and phenotypes, with supporting evidence. Essentially, this means it’s an archive of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/clinsig/\" target=\"_blank\">variants</a> associated with a gene. Variants are submitted typically by major diagnosing laboratories and research centers. Variants are classified as pathogenic (disease causing), benign (not disease causing), and unknown significance (not enough evidence to show the variant is disease causing or not).&nbsp;</p><h3>How do I see the SYNGAP1 variants in ClinVar?</h3><p>At the top of the ClinVar home page type “SYNGAP1” into the search:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/60217a56c1831ecc9024b69d_-Nu7n5pDNomrR7ji1EKQsDgqrYYo3xeDCdG0wNLEUOWZ3wPwNB-sChMO394dmyDG9fcr9yVNcZeE9r_kGwk20qFUovk5Aju-diUe0Iz2BnbZkZUdKrevV_uSGr_dI_Nq2PorbI6N.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>As of early February 2021, a search for the SYNGAP1 gene in Clinvar yields 533 results.&nbsp;</p><h3>Does this mean there are a total of 533 officially diagnosed patients with SYNGAP1 Encephalopathy (SYNGAP)?&nbsp;</h3><p>No. For a number of reasons:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/60217a578deff191e8262568_HaYjfOUfoaZRSdQ2jtYyyYZ6gVQfiXOwnJCRXt8KmBcToPHAJ20SxCD3egsDcx8BrQ48Fok1nuaZM9-nDsVtW5VHo_enqlIl9Umxj5spSJLzVZDFyS1ZY_FZaa__TjRvN4JNzE-W.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Firstly, the total count includes all variants, including those considered benign, likely benign, or uncertain&nbsp; significance. Individuals with benign variants are not considered to have a disease-causing variant. In other words, a SYNGAP1 variant is not causing their symptoms. All current evidence supports the assertion they do not have SYNGAP.&nbsp; Approximately one third (n=188) of the SYNGAP1 variants listed in ClinVar are considered benign.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, a decent chunk of listed variants are of uncertain significance (n=147), of which 142 are missense. This means there’s currently not enough evidence to confirm a diagnosis, which complicates the count of identified patients. You can read more about these <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/does-your-genetic-report-contain-a-variant-of-unknown-significance-vus-in-syngap1\" target=\"_blank\">uncertain variants</a> in our recent blog to see what types of new data will help determine their effect.</p><p>Finally we are left with pathogenic and likely pathogenic results which make up around 200 of the variants listed.&nbsp;</p><h3>Does this mean that there are about 200 people officially diagnosed with SYNGAP?&nbsp;</h3><p>Again, no. Here’s why:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/60217a576605ec30eb85329b_QrFK88NyktC20ukDDQuO_5GRUauVfVXz6w7z4VwRI9rJdzulGm84nBPVScv9WouM0qh0P0riBYaAeBV0KzYZ_3uEs5iuGC6SKufbXjFXp-iZLFWzZz5L67QXfMsSp58I_JbBYPk1.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Each entry in ClinVar is associated with a specific variant and multiple individuals can have the same variant. In the example highlighted, we filter for pathogenic nonsense variants. The first result illustrates there are multiple submitters for that particular variant: <a href=\"https://www.ambrygen.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ambry Genetics</a>, <a href=\"https://geneticcentre.org\" target=\"_blank\">Institute of Human Genetics</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.invitae.com\" target=\"_blank\">Invitae</a> in 2015, 2017 and 2019, respectively. Does that mean there are three people in the world with this variant? Maybe. We can’t be sure because the data are de-identified. It could be the case that the same person was tested at different times through different laboratories.</p><h3>So can we use ClinVar to approximate the number of officially diagnosed patients?&nbsp;</h3><p>Not really. ClinVar submissions are entirely voluntary. To list a variant in ClinVar, the laboratory has to go through a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/submit/\" target=\"_blank\">submission process</a>, which requires effort. Not every lab or research center has the time, budget, or inclination to submit the variant of every person they test.&nbsp;So all we can say is there are maybe around 200 people whose lab or research center has submitted their test results to Clinvar. But that leaves out a lot of diagnosed patients.</p><h3>So how do we get a good number of diagnosed patients?</h3><p>Great question. For many reasons, no SYNGAP patient registry currently contains all the diagnosed patients. Many families do not speak english. Some don’t have a copy of their genetic report. Many simply don’t have the capacity to participate. Does that mean those patients don’t exist? Does it mean they shouldn’t be counted?&nbsp;</p><p>The member organizations of the <a href=\"https://www.syngapglobal.net\" target=\"_blank\">SynGAP Global Network</a> (SRF is the only US member) believe patients should be counted regardless of their access to patient registries. That’s why in 2019 we started the <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/blog-categories/syngap-census\" target=\"_blank\">#SyngapCensus</a>. Every quarter we ask each patient organization or local support group: how many? Local organizations know their patient community best. They have FaceBook groups, WhatsApp groups, Weibo pages, vKontact pages, and are often very active! We also become aware of publications that describe diagnosed patients. Our global patient ambassadors perform outreach. They get updates from local neurologists about the number of diagnosed patients in their area and connect with them.</p><h3>But isn’t this incredibly inaccurate? What’s the point of this count?</h3><p>We are confident in our collaborative approach and if anything err towards not counting someone if we’re unsure. That being said, the #SyngapCensus was never intended to be a perfect dataset, indeed that’s not its purpose and we make that clear in each <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/4q20\" target=\"_blank\">update</a>. It’s a best-efforts collaborative estimate.</p><p>But it’s very important. Here’s why:</p><ul><li>It helps us reach and support more families. With our support, those families become part of the thriving <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SyngapGlobalFamilySupport/\" target=\"_blank\">SGN</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SyngapResearchFund/\" target=\"_blank\">SRF community</a>. We advise families how to obtain their genetic report so they can participate in registries and studies. In the US, we rolled out our natural history study with <a href=\"http://www.ciitizen.com/syngap1\" target=\"_blank\">Ciitizen</a> in part to enable our families to have better access and more control over their medical records.&nbsp;</li><li>We get a sense of the rate of diagnosis in different places. For example, more patients in China, India and <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348643107_SYNGAP1_mutation_in_a_pediatric_patient_with_autism_spectrum_disorder_and_intellectual_disability\" target=\"_blank\">Turkey</a> have recently started to be diagnosed/come to our attention.&nbsp;</li><li>Professionals have come to rely on rare disease patient organizations to know their community. When we talk about developing a treatment for SYNGAP1 and moving towards clinical trials, one of the most important things is to have an active, engaged and motivated patient community. #SyngapCensus is an indicator of just how well connected we are.&nbsp;</li></ul>",

More work needs to be done to understand how many orders of magnitude.</p><p>This article has three parts. The first walks through the previous literature about Syngap prevalence in certain studies. &nbsp;It was these studies that got us to the standard sound bite in the SynGAP community: “SynGAPians comprise ~1% of all cases of ID.” &nbsp;</p><p>The second part introduces a recent paper by Dr. Lal’s group &nbsp;and shares a remarkably high predicted incidence of Syngap mutations. &nbsp;Ranking Syngap against other well known NDD (neuro developmental disorder) &amp; DEE (developmental epileptic encephalopathies) diseases, suggests Syngap is comparable in size to Dravet and larger than CDKL5, Rett or Angelmans Syndrome. &nbsp; These are important comparisons since all of these diseases have therapies in development. To our knowledge, SynGAP does not, yet.</p><p>Finally, we peel the onion on that high incidence and look at how it breaks down between missense and PTV (protein-truncating variant) mutations. &nbsp;Here we realize that a higher number of predicted missense mutations than we were expecting actually begs more questions.</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>SRF Patient Advocates will often state that while the <a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/blog/1q20census\">#SynGAPCensus</a> indicates 535 identified patients worldwide at the end of 1Q20, the real number is much higher. &nbsp;What scientific evidence do we have for this claim?</p><p>Until a recent paper from a genetics group led by Dr. Dennis Lal, two recent scientific papers validated the view that the Syngap population is much larger than currently diagnosed. </p><p>First, the standard talking point in our community was most recently repeated in Gamache’s 20 year review of SynGAP: “<em>SYNGAP1</em> mutations may account for up to 1% of all cases of nonsyndromic ID.” &nbsp;As non-syndromic ID accounts for ~2.3% of the global population (Lemke 2020), then 1% of 2.3% is 0.023%, of humanity. &nbsp;With a global population of <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/\" target=\"_blank\">7.7 billion</a> then there are ~1.8 million SynGAPians &amp; we’ve counted just over <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VqzGRqXly3etkllhmxz6FQkuTi9CxRf76tASemfnFNQ/edit#gid=910500783\" target=\"_blank\">535</a>. &nbsp;In the US with a population of <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/us-population/\" target=\"_blank\">330 million</a>, we should have ~76,000, and we’ve only counted <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VqzGRqXly3etkllhmxz6FQkuTi9CxRf76tASemfnFNQ/edit#gid=910500783\" target=\"_blank\">162</a>.</p><p>Second, in a recent meeting to review an ICD-10 code for SynGAP, the CDC brief estimated that &nbsp;“&gt;1 million individuals predicted to be affected world-wide, making pathogenic SYNGAP1 variants more prevalent than Fragile X syndrome.” </p><p>A brief review of the data that supported these assertions is useful:</p><h3>EARLY STUDIES LOOKED AT COHORTS OF PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES AND FOUND SIMILAR PERCENTAGES WITH SYNGAP MUTATIONS.</h3><ul><li>Hamdan in 2009 noted that 3% of patients in his study with “non-syndromic mental retardation” had SYNGAP mutations.</li><li>Berryer in 2013 found that 9 of 186 [~5%] NSID &nbsp;(non-syndromic intellectual disability) patients had SYNGAP mutations.</li><li>Samocha in 2014 found that 3 of 151 [~2%] patients had SYNGAP mutations.</li></ul><h3>THE DDD STUDY IN THE UK REINFORCED BOTH THE IMPORTANCE &amp; RELATIVELY HIGH INCIDENCE OF SYNGAP.</h3><ul><li>2015 study of 1,133 patients found 7 with SynGAP mutations [0.6%]; this was the fifth most identified gene in the study.</li><li>2017 study called SynGAP one of the “six most significantly associated genes”</li><li>Noting here that this was a much larger cohort and the incidence came down from 2-5% to 0.6%. &nbsp;Read on.</li></ul><h3>MORE RECENT STUDIES VALIDATE SYNGAP1 AS A TOP DIAGNOSTIC GENE.</h3><ul><li>Wright in 2018 also found <em>SYNGAP1</em> to be the 6th most diagnostic gene after <em>RID1B, SATB2, SCN2A, ANKRD11, MED13L.</em></li><li>Truty, reviewing 9,413 patients tested with the Invitae panel found that <em>SYNGAP1</em> was the 10th highest incidence gene, accounting for 2.5% of positive diagnoses; notably, however in addition to the 39 hits, there were another 79 VUSs (“variants of unknown significance”).</li><li> Brimble, in a case report, pointed to an example of a VUS that was found to be pathogenic with RNA testing. &nbsp;How many other VUSs were actually pathogenic but not identified as such?</li></ul><h3>A RECENT STUDY SUPPORTS THE 0.5% - 1% RANGE</h3><ul><li>Johannesen et al in 2020, sequenced 200 patients with Epilepsy and ID in Denmark. &nbsp;46 patients [23%] had a genetic cause discovered; one 26 year-old had a SYNGAP1 mutation. &nbsp;1 in 200 is 0.5%.</li></ul><h1>Are all our missing patients just mild phenotypes?</h1><p>As Vlaskamp et. al. noted when commenting on their own excellent study, a detailed review of 57 SynGAP-affected patients, they “might have underestimated the prevalence of milder phenotypes due to ascertainment bias, given our recruitment via Facebook.” &nbsp;As a population, our experience has been that those patients who have milder phenotypes (relatively speaking) are less likely to be directed towards genetic testing. &nbsp;But how many are we missing? &nbsp;Are they all just mild phenotypes? &nbsp;55 / 57 of the patients in Vlaskamp’s study have seizures and 56/57 have intellectual disability-- are there many others out there without these afflictions, but with a mutated <em>SYNGAP1</em> gene that is causing disease? &nbsp;It’s not clear.</p><h1>Someone boiled a data ocean</h1><p>Until April 2020, what we’ve written so far is about as much as we knew. &nbsp;But then a group of geneticists led by Dr. Dennis Lal published a paper called <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7174049/\"><em>A catalogue of new incidence estimates of monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders caused by de novo variants</em></a> that also had a <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/143/4/1046/5823474\" target=\"_blank\">commentary from Lemke</a> in the same publication. &nbsp;It was only seven pages long, one table, one chart. &nbsp;But the magic was in a Supplementary Table, a link can be found at the end of the first paragraph in the <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/143/4/1099/5803191#202744647\">results section</a>. &nbsp;After you unzip the attachment and open the Excel file you find detailed estimates for incidence for 101 Established NDD (Neuro Developmental Disease) genes on the second tab. &nbsp;To save you the trouble we’ve put the data in a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1REedMvJCgzbTt7vtzK94KQA7_2KfarRbeniw87iAkt8/edit?usp=sharing\">Google sheet</a>.</p><p>The last author on this paper is Dr. Dennis Lal. &nbsp;He actively engages with rare disease groups and is someone SRF has followed since we met him last year. &nbsp;The &nbsp;affiliations on this paper is a list of leading medical institutions: the Cleveland Clinic, Cologne, Boston Children’s and the Broad. &nbsp;We asked Dr. Lal to explain in simple terms how the estimates were derived, and he kindly obliged. Essentially he took the average number of <em>de novo </em>mutations per person and looked at each gene’s length adjusted by the characteristics of each potential mutation. &nbsp;Based on that, he was able to generate incidence estimates of mutations on each gene. &nbsp;These incidences are represented as a number per 100,000 conceptions. This is our simplification of his simplification — his work is &nbsp;much more complex.</p><p>Only a few genes have these estimates already in the literature, but there were some. &nbsp;The paper includes a table that compares existing estimates to those from their analysis. &nbsp;For all genes but one, there was no significant difference. &nbsp;This suggests that the approach is valid.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-04 at 11.26.56 AM.png\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7a3dd7271c7a74b72395b_Screen%2BShot%2B2020-05-04%2Bat%2B11.26.56%2BAM.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>So what was the number for SYNGAP1? &nbsp;<strong>6.107 per 100,000</strong> (the range was 5.7 to 6.5). &nbsp;That means that in the USA, which had a birth cohort of 3.8M in 2018, there would be over 230 SynGAPians born every year. &nbsp;It also means that the previously mentioned incidence of 0.023% might be ~4x too large — but even if you cut the projections to a quarter &nbsp;(6.107/100,000 = &nbsp;0.006%, of humanity), globally we’d expect &nbsp;~0.46 million SynGAPians vs. a count of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VqzGRqXly3etkllhmxz6FQkuTi9CxRf76tASemfnFNQ/edit#gid=910500783\">535</a>; &nbsp;In the US we’d expect &nbsp;~20,000, and we’ve only counted <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VqzGRqXly3etkllhmxz6FQkuTi9CxRf76tASemfnFNQ/edit#gid=910500783\">162</a>) the comparison between the existing diagnoses and the expected numbers suggests that we are radically under-diagnosed. &nbsp;</p><h1>But wait… the kinds of mutations matter</h1><p>When you double click on the incidence predicted by Dr. Lal’s group, that incidence of 6.107 for a <em>SYNGAP1</em> mutation is broken down into two kinds of mutations: PTV and missense. This is where it becomes interesting.</p><p>Let’s take a step back. Patients with SynGAP have one functioning gene and one that is not functioning properly (this is why it is called a haploinsufficiency). The one that is not functioning properly could be a PTV (“protein truncating variant”), which means a mutation that results in the protein being shorter than it should be. &nbsp; As a result, the body looks at the protein and can’t make sense of it, and therefore disposes of it (this process is sometimes called NMD or “nonsense mediated decay”). &nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, the gene that is not functioning properly could be a “missense mutation,” which happens when the typo in the gene still causes a protein to be produced, but produced in such a way that it causes a change in the function of the protein. &nbsp;The impact of these mutations isn’t uniform, and there are many open questions as to what damage this mis-functioning protein can cause. </p><p>The predictions from Dr. Lal’s group, however, estimated the PTV incidence is 0.787 &amp; the missense incidence is 5.320. &nbsp;They predict almost seven missense mutants for each nonsense mutant -- to SynGAP parents, who typically hear more about nonsense patients, this is surprising.</p><h1>Where are all the missense patients?</h1><p>When a genetic diagnosis is made, the mutation that it causes is entered in a database called ClinVar. &nbsp;If you have enough bioinformatics training you can work with that, but for rare parents, a site called <a href=\"http://simple-clinvar.broadinstitute.org/\">Simple ClinVar</a> does the trick. &nbsp;It was built by Dr. Lal and his apparently tireless team. &nbsp;</p><p>If you go to Simple ClinVar, type in SYNGAP1 and sort for pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations you find 132 distinct mutations, 21 of which were missense. &nbsp;So in the literature today, for mutations that cause or likely cause disease, we have 4 mutations that weren’t missesene for every mutation that was -- this feels approximately right based on the numbers in our community. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-13 at 3.26.22 PM.png\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7a3ddef0c0b25f4851b16_Screen%2BShot%2B2020-05-13%2Bat%2B3.26.22%2BPM.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>However, Remember, Lal’s model predicted that there are 7 missense mutations for every PTV, so this clinical data is at odds with the genetic model. &nbsp;But maybe the missense mutations aren’t getting picked up as being pathogenic? However, even if you don't filter for pathogenicity and look at the big picture, you see 370 known variants, 129 of which are missense. &nbsp;That one missense mutation for every ~2 PTV, instead of &nbsp;7:1. &nbsp;Clearly patients with missense mutations are not getting diagnosed -- why could this be?</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-13 at 3.41.56 PM.png\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7a3dd5cb4fde3c43686d8_Screen%2BShot%2B2020-05-13%2Bat%2B3.41.56%2BPM.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Noting that <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/?term=Syngap1%5Bgene%5D\" target=\"_blank\">in Clinvar there are 444 SYNGAP1</a> variants noted, not 370. &nbsp;When Simple Clinvar is updated, we will write an update for this article.</p><h1>Where are the Syngapians?</h1><p>Dr. Johannes R. Lemke wrote a commentary on the predictions from López-Rivera, et al. (Lal’s group) in which he put forward an answer. &nbsp;One paragraph sums it up, so I quote it here in its entirety:</p><blockquote>“However, despite the thorough statistical calculations, the list of incidence estimates is still vulnerable to a few factors that could potentially cause the expected/calculated incidences to deviate from clinically observed frequencies. A gene may be ranked with a somewhat higher incidence if it has high genetic constraint scores and is extraordinarily large (e.g. DYNC1H1 with 4646 amino acids, which is first on the list, or KMT2D with 5537 amino acids, which is third). The same overestimation may occur if the associated phenotypic spectrum comprises embryonically lethal phenotypes that will escape detection by routine screening of affected living individuals. By contrast, the predicted incidence may be underestimated if a gene is rather small or its associated phenotype lies towards the mild-to-normal end of the phenotypic spectrum, with the result that mildly or subclinically affected individuals may be recruited among healthy control populations.</blockquote><p>Said differently, larger genes will be higher on the list just because the size of the gene increases that chance that one of few de novo mutations everyone has lands on that gene. &nbsp;Syngap is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/AQY77139.1\" target=\"_blank\">1345 amino acids</a> long so it is not that big. &nbsp;But the two points that follow are what matter.</p><p>Recall the comment we made earlier: that missense mutations, by nature of the way they operate, each cause the affected protein to be expressed in a different way. As such, both elements of Lemke’s argument could be true for SynGAP patients affected by missense mutations. </p><p>On one hand, we may have lots of people out there with Syngap missense mutations that aren’t causing pronounced disease; the “<strong><em>associated phenotype lies towards the mild-to-normal end of the phenotypic spectrum.</em></strong><em>”</em> &nbsp;And as a result we aren’t getting them diagnosed. &nbsp;This brings up questions of whether the phenotype is mild, or if it just takes longer to manifest--median seizure onset is at age 2 per Vlaskamp--and then we have people who are presenting with symptoms later in life and as a result are not receiving genetic testing.</p><p>On the other hand, there may be missense mutations that are “<strong>embryonically lethal</strong>” and these Syngapians don’t even make it to birth. &nbsp;This hypothesis would be theoretically supported by the fact that, although all PTV’s behave the same way (conceptually), different missense mutations may have different impacts. It could be that some of the missense mutations are embryonically lethal, whereas others (those of the patients we know and love) cause the disease known as SYNGAP1-Related Intellectual Disability or SYNGAP1-Related Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy (Holder 2019).</p><h1>Conclusion - We need more research</h1><p>When I first saw Dr. Lal’s number I was glad to see that we had some data to validate the anecdotes from the cohort studies that there are many more SynGAPians. &nbsp;Finally, there was a major scientist publishing what we believe. &nbsp;But at the end of all this thinking, we have new and more nuanced questions, and the same next step: Do more research. &nbsp;There are cohorts in the UK, Denmark and others where large populations have been sequenced and we could imagine a study where we seek out undiagnosed Syngap mutations and work to better understand their effects. &nbsp;This feels important since we still keep finding SynGAPians that were missed. &nbsp;A quick review of the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/syngapfund/\">weekly profile by SRF</a> will highlight a few people diagnosed in their 20s or 30s. &nbsp;So we keep working for our patients and all the ones not yet diagnosed who we are every more certain are out there.</p><p>See slides associated with this article <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JaSeGx0TZ69gfFtrhpcsWGIo3cUuv7ERo2la3X8kL18/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>. &nbsp;Please send comments to the author at <a href=\"mailto:Mike@SyngapResearchFund.org\">Mike@SyngapResearchFund.org</a>.</p><h3>BIBLIOGRAPHY</h3><p>Berryer MH, Hamdan FF, Klitten LL, et al.

All of these people need to understand the range of severity of our patients, the progression of the disease and, most importantly, the heartbreaking beauty of our children. With only <a href=\"http://bit.ly/SRF_4PbyP_HowMany\" target=\"_blank\">406</a> diagnosed patients (when we wrote this) spread around the world, this channel is potent way to get to know each other and share our community with all our friends and partners.</p><p><strong>We do it to help each other.</strong></p><p>Parents who only live miles apart but were not aware of each other have connected because of these posts. Families in remote spots have been introduced the broader community after being profiled. One patient at a time, one week at a time, we get to know each other better. Almost by definition, rare disease communities connect online so these platforms help us “get to know” the kids we may never meet but care about so much. Parents who are newly diagnosed are eager for a chance to understand how things progress, to peek into their potential futures, the photos and videos of smiles, EEGs, hugs, horses, therapy rooms… all of it help to remind us we are not alone; we have a community.</p><p><strong>We were inspired by giants in the rare disease community.</strong></p><p>When we stood up SRF we looked for best in class organizations to model ourselves on, two are DSF the <a href=\"https://www.dravetfoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Dravet Syndrome Foundation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kif1a.org/\" target=\"_blank\">KIF1A.org</a>. If you check out the DSF <a href=\"https://twitter.com/curedravet\" target=\"_blank\">twitter feed</a> or that of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KIF1A\" target=\"_blank\">KIF1A</a>, you can find numerous <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WarriorWednesday?src=hashtag_click\" target=\"_blank\">#WarriorWednesday</a> tweets. The simple act of putting faces to these “rare” diseases help people connect with us and with each other.</p><p><strong>Syngap1 patients are true warriors.</strong></p><p>Merriam-Webster dictionary defines the word “warrior” as “a noun, often attributive — a person engaged in some struggle or conflict.”</p><p>Day in and day out, children and adults with Syngap1 are facing an immense struggle. They have a long list of diagnoses and even longer list of medications, supplements, and therapies. Here’s the catch, there is no cure. “Syngapians” as they are often called are the true warriors.

    "Post Body": "<p><a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/patient-support-profiles/summer\"><em>Summer</em></a><em> is a SRF Family Ambassador and Syngap Mom of Ryker</em>.<br><br>As I was driving down the road with my non-verbal son in the back seat it hit me. What would I do if we were in an accident? What if I was knocked unconscious or worst died at the scene? How would emergency personnel know what to do with Ryker? Would he resist? Would he be aggressive? Would he use his talker and know to ask for help? How would Ryker get the care he needed? My mind can paint a worst-case scenario in remarkable detail.</p><p>A parent raising a child with special needs has to consider too many things and be prepared the best they can. Having your vehicle &amp; child labeled for first responders is one option to consider.</p><p>Amazon and Etsy offer a variety of stickers and decals for your vehicle. &nbsp;(SRF does not receive any compensation for these mentions.) For instance: </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:444px\"><div><img alt=\"Sample of Emergency Sticker from Amazon\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fc7ab2a71efc655c54f501e_Screenshot%2B2020-02-14%2Bat%2B8.26.51%2BAM.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Sample of Emergency Sticker from Amazon</figcaption></figure><p>Another option I found to be very beneficial is the seat belt covers. The decals are great to get the attention of paramedics and police officers from outside the vehicle. Seat belt covers offer more detailed information about your child once emergency crews locate your child inside the car. &nbsp;Name, specific details to help emergency personnel understand your child and emergency contact information.

Other things I wanted them to know is that he is developmentally delayed and most likely won’t comprehend what is happening. Ryker suffers from seizures and can be aggressive; all things that will help emergency crews to help care for Ryker till family or friends can get to him.</p><p>This along with Wills can be very heavy and hard to think about, but are crucial to be prepared so our kiddos are taken care of “if” we are unable too. </p><p><br></p><p>‍</p>",

    "Post Body": "<p><a href=\"https://syngapresearchfund.org/team-profiles/hans-p-schlecht-md-science-amp-medicine-lead\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Hans</em></a><em> is a parent to a son with SYNGAP1 deficiency and since March 2017, an advocate for advancing the care and research for this rare disease. We are grateful to Hans for his work on the SRF Board of Directors &amp; leading the committee of parent Scientists &amp; Clinicians.</em></p><p>As a new member of the SynGAP1 parent club, one of the first things I asked another more experienced parent was “How are the nights?” The parent explained that their little darling slept on a mattress on the floor, got up in the middle of the night, and played on their own. “I think they can see in the dark.” It was incredibly memorable and made planning &nbsp;sleep a priority for me and my family. One of the keys to good sleep is something called sleep hygiene. These are the habits that promote or sabotage good sleep. Do you drink espresso after dinner? Good luck getting sleep. Do you watch TV from bed? Good luck staying asleep. In short, our brains are easily tricked into forgetting that a bed is where you sleep at night. As a medical professional myself, I often explain to patients that bad sleep hygiene includes thoughts such as, “Hey, I’m in bed. I wonder what’s on TV?” Or “Where is my phone? I need a dose of Twitter.” In the same way, I did not want my SynGAPian to be too busy “thinking” in the middle of the night, “Where’s my swing? Where’s the TV? Where is everybody? I gotta find everything and everyone.” </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"static1.squarespace.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb549d07ffba801ec822112_static1.squarespace.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>That’s where a safety bed comes in! As soon as my little guy could get close to climbing out of his crib, we recognized the need to start the process of researching safety bed options. We <a href=\"https://www.kayserbettenus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">liked the firm KayserBetten</a> because of the range of beds they manufacture and offer online. They are familiar with the insurance hurdles and do the legwork for you to ensure a smooth process. We provided them<em> </em>with some basic information and a <em>medical record release</em> and they handled the rest. </p><p>In the end it was paid for by our insurance since it was a <strong><em>safety </em></strong>issue. Once our little one showed signs of being able to “escape” his room — all kinds of worries kept us up at night — the fear of our child falling down the stairs or leaving the house (once old enough), or even turning on the stove.</p><p>Consequently, insurance companies want families to demonstrate that there is a medical necessity and that the purchase of the bed (or <em>any </em>other equipment, for that matter) is necessary to keep the child or patient safe at night and that the current set-up fails to do so. If you decided to select a safety bed manufacturer that does not help you navigate the insurance maze - make sure to submit a script from your doctor and a <em>Letter of Medical Necessity </em>that includes the following:</p><ol><li>Description of your child’s Syngap1 diagnosis and all other diagnoses (e.g. epilepsy, low-muscle tone, Intellectual Disability)</li><li>Explanation of why the current bed does not sufficiently keep your child safe (and instead poses a safety risk)</li><li>Without making mention of the exact safety bed model you are interested in - provide a description of all features you need with a detailed justification (e.g. “child needs full rails to keep from falling out during seizures) </li></ol><p><em>Note</em>: For more information on how to get insurance to cover the cost read <a href=\"http://www.articles.complexchild.com/jan2009/00095.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">this article.</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>For us, securing insurance coverage did take some time but it was overall a smooth process. We were told that insurance does, at times, deny coverage but that the appeals process is well worth it (since they mostly approve after one round of denial). So don’t feel discouraged if you are denied coverage on the first try!</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\"><div><img alt=\"IMG-3632.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa7dd058c8d62f8d5b9cd0c/5fb549d0ececdb8d23e026ca_IMG-3632.jpeg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>It’s no fun closing the gates on my little guy every night but it builds a habit that gets him and the rest of the family a good night’s sleep and in the long run, preserves our sanity for the marathon of parenting a special needs child.</p><p>Now it’s been 18 months and most nights are an 8:30pm bedtime and 6am wake up call. He does stir in the night but usually goes right back down. I would like to think that’s because his brain says, “Well, it’s dark, I’m in my bed so I guess I’ll just go right back to sleep. After all, I don’t do anything else at this place and time.”</p><p><br></p><p>‍</p>",
