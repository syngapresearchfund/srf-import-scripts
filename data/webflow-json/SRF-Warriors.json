    "Full Story": "<p>Akira is 7 years old and was diagnosed with Syngap1 at age 3. The journey from birth to diagnosis was very difficult with many sleepless nights and lots of worry. Akira had hundreds of seizures per day including absent with eye fluttering, myoclonic jerks and atonic. We struggled to find doctors who believed us about how fragile Akira was. Finally, at the age of 6 we got the evidence we needed; an EEG showing hundreds and hundreds of seizures over a 24 hour period. Akira loves horseriding, swimming, the beach, school and her Autism Assistance Dog Jagger. She has started to learn to use Proloquotogo on her ipad to communicate. . Akira is living a wonderful life now full of all of her favourite activities. Akira is gentle, loving, affectionate and cute as a button. She loves to get tickled and play peek a boo and chasey. We adore Akira. She is an angel from heaven.</p><p> - Valli, Mom</p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Alaina was diagnosed with SynGAP1 in December of 2020. We had suspected some seizure activity when she was an infant and since then have done multiple EEG’s. As of now, she has no seizure activity to date.</p><p>The first thing that anyone who meets her notices is her big smile. Alaina has pure happiness and joy in her laugh. She is also in constant demand of cuddles.</p><p>Alaina's favorite thing in the world is playing with water and musical instruments.&nbsp; She enjoys any and all light up toys as well.</p><p>She is continuously meeting her goals in therapy and has truly come a long way in the last year. We are hoping to continue improving communication using the PECS system as well as working on potty training.</p><p>Her diagnosis and all the support we have found in the SynGAP1 community has opened our world to new found hope and an optimistic outlook on Alaina's future. We are grateful to have the opportunity to witness and support the research that hopefully one day will help Alaina and all the other children with SynGAP1.<br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Andrew was first diagnosed with autism, epilepsy, and global developmental delay at the age of two. It wasn’t until last summer, when Andrew was 16, that a new round of genetic testing revealed his SynGap1 diagnosis. Needless to say, it was a life-altering moment for our family, as we had been searching for our “why” for such a long time.<br></p><p>Andrew is now 17, and attends a specialized non-public school dedicated to providing students with autism and related disorders access to a robust, individualized education in a safe, compassionate, accommodating environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Andrew has many interests, including bounce houses, the beach, swimming, watching YouTube videos and playing with his iPad, going to church, Disneyland, watching favorite scenes from Disney Pixar movies such as Monsters Inc and Cars, playing Little League Challenger baseball, going bowling, and spending time with his best friend in the whole world, his brother Ian.&nbsp;</p><p>While Andrew does have verbal approximations, he does not talk in the traditional sense. However, Andrew utilizes a variety of low and high tech functional communication skills, including sign language, gesturing, pointing, using his speech device (Proloquo2go on a dedicated iPad) and other creative means of getting his point across, which we like to refer to Andrew’s Charades!” Recently Andrew began taking Epidiolex for his intractable epilepsy, and has been seizure free for two weeks! Woohoo!</p><p>Andrew is affectionate, funny, smart, loving, creative, and continues to grow in amazing ways. He brings such joy to everyone who knows him, and we are in awe of his unique perspective on the world. While his diagnoses often cause Andrew many challenges, he is our hero and we are so very proud of him! <br></p><p>- Jo (Mom)</p><p><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Anton is full of life and is a very happy child. He received the Syngap1 diagnosis in June of 2019. He has taught our family a lot about patience and understanding. We love him so much.</p><p>He goes to a special kindergarten where they are able to cater to his needs. Similar to other kids with Syngap1, he’s in many different therapies to help improve his skills. Anton is non-verbal but he can communicate using sign language (he has about 35 signs). Just recently, he got an iPad to use for communication and that has been helping a lot. We feel that although he cannot express himself verbally that he understands most of what we say.</p><p>Anton does not have any visible seizures but his EEG’s have shown “abnormal brain activity”. So we believe that he may be having seizures that we cannot see.</p><p>Anton enjoys spending all of his time outdoors. He loves going on walks in the woods. Anton can spend lots of time at the playground, climbing on the structures. Swimming, horses, playing with toys, music, and dancing are a few of his favorite things.</p><p> - Claudia, mom<br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>We discovered Ari had global developmental delay at 18 months and started OT, PT, and Speech Therapy shortly after. Although his learning pace is far behind other kids he progresses every day. He is an adorable kid that everyone loves when they first meet him. Ari has not been given an autism diagnosis. His therapists have said his social skills are the best among all of his skill sets.</p><p>We knew there was better explanation to his delays, soon we realized that he was having seizures. He had an EEG and genetic testing done, which confirmed our suspicions. Ari was finally diagnosed with Syngap1 just 12 days before his 4th birthday.</p><p>After all of these years we learned to focus on what he CAN do instead of what he cannot. Ari is always a happy boy, he loves music, water, and loves seeing trains. He is a sensitive boy that can feel our love and responds to it. Ari is our little angel that comes to heal us and teach us what true love is.</p><p>Getting the Syngap1 diagnosis from the doctor may have been one of the worst days of our lives but then our days have only gotten better as we have been able to see him progressing and improving day after day. He will only get better. - Mom</p><p><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Bear is almost 4 years old, and was diagnosed with SYNGAP1 in February 2020. He starting missing milestones around 2 years of age (mainly speech), and, in September 2019, he was diagnosed with severe epilepsy.</p><p>Right now, we have seizure control - through a combination of Epilim and Keppra. However, as Bear’s behaviour has worsened over the last six months (biting/pinching/kicking), we are considering adjusting his meds. He uses 2-3 word sentences, and his language is, predominantly, functional, but he is starting to develop emotional language. Bear has speech therapy once a week, and he slowly continues to improve.</p><p>Bear is the most positive, happy child, and he absolutely adores his brothers (ages 6 and 17 months). He struggles with fine motor skills and general coordination, but that never stops him from climbing, sliding, swinging, jumping and just generally taking risks. His high pain threshold is a blessing, in this regard!</p><p>Bear, like a typical Syngapian, loves being in water, riding horses and watching an iPad. He is extremely willful, and a runner, which can be challenging. His sleep is poor, and he often wakes at night. Appetite-wise, he will either eat a lot or nothing at all.</p><p>We love Bear to pieces, and he is adored by all who know him. With his beautiful smile, and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes, he has all our family and friends wrapped around his little finger! We will continue to fight for him, and all our Syngapians, so that they can lead the fullest of lives.”<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/katrien.deckers.3?__cft__[0]=AZVnq-4VJ-BzHGYQhAjfHbOtPO0C6SZ6ZxUZR6xCS-NYXr8MMd9QwCcqS1xCGTVUz9KWzpNTP-zDXUSjxJvvZ_KHjeXdG0rm3eiNocxYT3eL7j5y8zD59YwFN41LNr-cY-pruMRs5rWjNHk-7xe1Roof&__tn__=-]K-R\"> </a></p><p>-Mom</p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>After a two-year medical marathon with countless examinations, we received the Syngap1 diagnosis in April of 2017.</p><p>Benjamin is a very happy little boy! After learning to walk at 2 years old, nothing was safe for him. Benjamin sees no danger. He has no awareness of cars, buses, and tractors that drive through the village. In addition to the lack of risk awareness, he also has problems with perception. He feels pain much later or not at all. So it happens again and again before he reaches the power fence for the cows, and is then standing with the cows! Benjamin always needs 1:1 care, you cannot take your eyes off of him.</p><p>Animals are a big passion of his. Cows, horses, cars, and our golden retriever, Grace. The first two weeks we had Grace was very difficult. Benjamin would pull her fur constantly. Luckily now, the two are very close. Benjamin seeks her and Grace does not leave his side if he is having a meltdown.</p><p>Benjamin is very active and likes to be on the move! He likes to run around the hockey turf with his hockey stick when his siblings are training. In addition to hockey, he also loves water and swimming. He loved music, preferably very loud.</p><p>As of September, he has started a special school. Benjamin’s vocabulary is of about 10-15 words. If he learns a new word, another disappears. In addition to gestures, he communicates with the talker. Benjamin has small seizures that are invisible to the naked eye.<br></p>"

He has behavioral issues that require medication such as: Aripiprazole and Mitrazipine to keep under control.</p><p>Brendan enjoys coming home on the weekend to visit his family. His favorite thing to do is to go train spotting, he can spend a few hours a day viewing his favorite trains and visiting train stations.

She has been working hard on all of the areas she struggles. Callie has finally started to use a high tech communication device and is learning her colors! Soon we’re getting a device with the program proloque2go and the easiest way to put it is “ I’m so happy!”. <br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>After 64 years of searching for answers, Caren received her SynGAP1 diagnosis in June of 2020 after surviving COVID-19.&nbsp; Caren, our sister and myself participated in a Trio Whole Exome Sequencing test, which uncovered this remarkable discovery. Some of Caren’s diagnoses through her life have included Mental Retardation, Epilepsy, Autism Spectrum Disorder, hypotonia, congenital foot deformity, ataxia, sleeping irregularities, chronic constipation, Schizophrenia and Explosive Disorder. </p><p>Despite her struggles with various conditions, I would describe Caren as an affectionate, humorous and happy person. She loves to color, write letters, dress up, sing and dance. Above all, she is quite a foodie! Caren is the first born of four children and loves her family. She misses her late parents, and I believe they would have loved to learn that she is a SynGAPian.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Caren was first described as a fussy baby who would not breast feed. After only being ten days old, doctors recommended my mother to start using formula. According to Caren’s baby book, she would rebel during the introduction of solid foods and frequently gagged. At seven months old, Caren experienced her first seizure episode, and would continue to experience grand mal, petite mal, absence and generalized seizures throughout her life. More recently, Caren has been observed to have focal seizures.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In addition to trouble feeding and seizures, her developmental milestones were delayed. Caren first walked at fourteen months, and she only began to talk after three and a half years of age. Through childhood, Caren’s disabilities and behaviors were managed in various residential institutions. From the ages of eight to eleven Caren lived at home in an effort to try different learning approaches. After this time, she moved back into another residential home where she participated in the Special Olympics, community outings, dances, and vacations. She was even featured in several local new articles.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In 2013, our family moved Caren to a group home that was located closer to us. Her current group home and rehabilitation day program provides various necessary services such as occupational, physical and speech therapy, and 24-hour nursing supervision. Before the pandemic, Caren also participated in community experiences.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Currently, Caren speaks in short sentences and has learned to read and write phonetically at a basic level. Although Caren’s motor skills are not what they used to be, she is happy to just hold a crayon. She is very strong willed. Overall, Caren is loved by almost everyone who meets her!<br></p><p>My hope for the future is that Caren will continue to have the best quality of life and care, be happy, comfortable, and to be an inspiration for others. As the oldest known SynGAPian at this time, I believe Caren’s story can provide insight for upcoming research and therapies.&nbsp;<br></p><p>I feel blessed to have the support of SRF and this caring community. Once I found SRF, I realized I was no longer alone. I am now part of a larger family that understands and has amazing resources. I know that SRF is moving mountains for our SynGAPians! My advice to newly diagnosed families is to surround yourself with support, lean on each other, embrace this community in a way that you are comfortable with and make sure to take time to care for you! Our SynGAPians are truly happy, curious and amazing people!</p><p>Special thanks to Mike Graglia and the amazing SRF, the SRF directors, Daniel DeFabio and Illumina for sponsoring and supporting #CelebratingCaren! Please join us for the watch party by <a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/caren\" target=\"_blank\">registering</a>!</p><p>-Nancy, Caren's sister<br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Carter is a two-year-old on the move! He’s eager to explore his environment and how e v e r y t h i n g&nbsp;works! At 6 months old, we began noting developmental delays/low muscle tone. An MRI was conducted and returned normal. We began with weekly physical, occupational and speech therapies. Seizures started in March of this year and increased to 50-100/daily at worst. This spurred more EEGs, multiple attempts at medication for seizure control (still ongoing), more lab work than any toddler should endure, epilepsy panel, and whole exome sequencing. On July 30, 2019, Carter received his SYNGAP1 diagnosis — and the symptoms all matched.</p><p>Carter attends ABA therapy, focused on socialization, and improved behavior/speech. He is mostly non-verbal, but has begun mimicking/saying a few words. The newest being “baby,” since he just became a big brother in the past few weeks! We’ve also begun introducing sign language.&nbsp;</p><p>Carter has become very independent as he’s gained confidence with walking (still a bit wobbly)! He’s a sweet, happy and charming baby — he’ll instantly steal your heart! We indescribably love this boy and will do anything to give him the best life possible!<br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Caspian's biggest challenges started around six months of age when he could not and would not try to eat solid foods. After an exhaustive amount of doctor visits and advocating for some help, he was finally referred for multiple services. From then on Caspian had weekly visits with speech therapy and physiotherapy. And after a few months with the habilitation team Caspian was diagnosed with Autism at the age of 2. At 18 months of age Caspian started eating for the first time and by 2.5 years of age he was eating enough to stop breast feeding safely.</p><p>Sadly we had a little turn back in October 2019 when what we thought was autistic stimming behavior turned into an epilepsy diagnosis. Caspian started medication right away however, none were doing the trick. They took CT scans, spinal fluid, EEG and genetic testing. All tests came back normal, it was just the genetic. test we waited a few months for...</p><p>In May of 2020, our beautiful son received a new diagnosis of Syngap1 syndrome. Even though this was a huge surprise for us, this new diagnosis gives us answers to why Caspian has such difficult epilepsy.</p><p>Caspian is a very happy and playful little boy. He laughs a lot and loves cuddles from those who are close to him. Water has always been his favorite everything! Right now water is his relaxation when he has a lot of seizures a bath relaxes him and his seizures seem to rest for a while. He also loves the trampoline and he has just recently learnt to jump by himself with the help from his big sister, who is usually teaching him all those fun skills! And another passion of his is dancing and music! Caspian's laugh and smile can melt anyone's heart when he dances with you!</p><p>- Mom</p><p><em>To learn more about Caspian you can read </em><a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/caspian\" target=\"_blank\"><em>this article</em></a><em> by his mom or </em><a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/caspian-got-a-g-tube\" target=\"_blank\"><em>this one about his G-Tube</em></a><em>.</em><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Celia was diagnosed with Syngap1 at 17, by chance, after her participation in a study done in a hospital in Barcelona. Prior to that she had undergone many tests with no results. When she was much younger (5-6 years) Celia went to many hospitals in the US to try and get a diagnosis but nothing came of it at the time. But now that we have a diagnosis we are receiving great help from our local neurologist who specializes in epilepsy.</p><p>Celia has no verbal communication, only 4 words, motor problems to walk, severe intellectual disability, severe disruptive behavior and she is very sensitive to stimuli.</p><p>Until she was 19, Celia attended school in a special needs classroom. Unfortunately her seizures have prevented her from attending school regularly. Celia suffers from generalized, drop, and myoclonic seizures.</p><p>The key to keeping Celia happy is maintaining an active lifestyle. Walks, swimming, going to the beach, are all activities she enjoys doing regularly.</p><p>When she was younger she traveled a lot with the family but now it is not possible due to behavior. She likes going for a ride in the car and loves getting into buses to go to the city center. Celia has always kept up a heavy therapy schedule as well.</p><p>She loves music, dancing, using make-up, dolls, using her ipad for music, etc. She communicates in a very effective way trying all the strategies she has (signing, inventing her own signs, pulling other’s people hands), she is very energetic and seems happy all the time, she needs a friendly environment and no stress at all.</p><p>She is under strong medication in order to control behavior and epilepsy. Medication apparently produced ammonium high levels in blood, during the last year she is having difficulties for walking and we have to use a wheelchair frequently. However, in the last two weeks she is gaining some strength after some drug changes.<br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>After 3 years of searching for answers, Chase was diagnosed with Syngap1 in October of 2019. He started to miss milestones early on as a baby. Since then, he has been receiving OT, PT, and Speech Therapy and has gone through countless tests. We knew from the beginning that something was different about Chase and that he didn’t seem to match any diagnosis that we knew of. He began having seizures when he was 3 years old and we finally got the testing that we had been fighting for from the start, which is when we got the Syngap diagnosis.</p><p>Although Chase struggles through countless seizures, coordination issues, and motor delays - he is still the happiest little boy there is. He wins everyone over with his big amazing smile and his contagious laugh. Chase is so resilient and when he falls or do not succeed at something he gets back up and tries again. His easy going personality and eagerness to learn despite his struggles are an inspiration.</p><p>For a little guy who sometimes struggles to walk and run, he absolutely shines on his 3 wheeled scooter! He can scooter so fast that we have to run to keep up. Along with riding his scooter, he also enjoys blowing bubbles, swimming, reading books, and listening to music. Chase uses a communication device at home and school. He is learning to put two words together on his device. Chase still does not have seizure control, but we are hoping to figure out what works best for him soon.</p><p>-Mom<br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Chloe lives at home and 5 days a week she goes to a daycenter for complex needs in our town. She also has access to respite which means she has a lovely social circle. Chloe attended a specialized school up until she was 19 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The SynGAP1 diagnosis only came 3 years ago, after being on the DDD study for 4 years. It was a huge relief! Originally At 3 years old, Chloe was diagnosed as being non verbal, having global developmental delays and hypotonia. It has been quite a journey since then. At age 7, Chloe was diagnosed with a Rett syndrome variant, despite having a negative test for the mecp2 gene. Eventually the Rett’s diagnosis was withdrawn when Chloe was 14. She didn’t display any of the major signs of Rett’s. Chloe did not receive an epilepsy diagnosis until the age of 18. When Chloe was 15, she experienced the major loss of her grandad, which caused major regression. We lost our Chloe for a very long time.</p><p>Chloe is a very different young lady to the child she was. Chloe was very sociable, her mobility was better, and she was generally more managable, Now her behaviors now are much more challenging. She’s now finally progressing after years of regression. In my opinion, her regression was caused by grief.</p><p>Chloe loves male company, she loves the show Tweenies, she is an wizz on youtube, loves spinning flashing lights, pajamas, yogurt and crisps. Chloe lives at home with her mum, dad and her two brothers who are 9 and 11. We are fortunate enough that our home was adapted for Chloe. She has a ground floor bedroom with a wet room. So we can keep Chloe home for as long as we can.<br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>We got the call from our geneticist last year on New Year’s Eve that our Christian had Syngap1. As his mother, I’ve always been his biggest advocate. I knew something was awry when Christian was around 12 months old and was not reaching some developmental milestones.</p><p>Christian began physical and occupational therapy around 14 months old. It was Christian’s occupational therapist who alerted us that Christian was having seizures. We were naïve that seizures came in so many types, so we simply did not know. We immediately took Christian to a neurologist who has helped tremendously. Christian has atonic seizures and eyelid myoclonia. Last December Christian had a corpus callosotomy performed which has dropped his atonic seizures from hundreds a day to 0-2 a day. Christian was also diagnosed with autism just last week so now he will be starting ABA therapy shortly. We hope to see some gains from this therapy.</p><p>Christian is the sweetest boy. He loves hugs and kisses and being tickled.&nbsp; He loves water and will play in it for hours. He loves his kiddie pool and bubble baths are his favorite. Christian loves to watch Sesame Street and even claps along to the songs. He loves car rides with the window down so the wind can blow in his face. Christian is surrounded by love from his family. Christian brings us so much joy and we could not imagine our lives without him.</p><p> - Mom</p><p><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Claira Beth will be celebrating her 10th birthday this summer! She has lived 5 years with the Syngap diagnosis. Reaching that diagnosis at 5 years old was a long stressful adventure. Her original diagnosis’ were global developmental delay, nonverbal, hypotonia, and mental retardation- all at 17 months. By 2 years old, she was diagnosed with autism. The neuropsychologist who diagnosed her made a stunning comment, “I wouldn’t be shocked, if sometime in her future, you came back to me and told me it [Autism symptoms] was genetic.” Then, 3 years later, after witnessing seizure activity, she was diagnosed with a genetic disorder, known as Syngap.<br></p><p>Today, Claira presents with atonic drop seizures, absence seizures, and eye flutters. She enjoys her service dog, Soleil, and he keeps her safe. He’s trained in tracking (she elopes), seizure alert, and behavior disruption. The behaviors are our biggest challenge. They can be intense most days, but she has the biggest heart and most beautiful smile!</p><p>Claira loves horses, cows, moons, fish, and swimming. She’s happiest riding... on anything really! She’s completely nonverbal, with a few simple signs and an iPad for communication. Weather permitting, you will find her in the pool most of the year if she’s at home!</p><p>She has opened our world in more ways than one, and puts a smile on everyone’s face she meets! <br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Colette was diagnosed with SYNGAP1-related NSID in 2018. She received an early autism diagnosis in 2014 and we just “knew” that there was going to be more to her story. We saw a lot of things we’ve since learned are extremely common among others in the community: delayed/non-existent verbal communication, absence seizures, low muscle tone, and so on. Getting the results of her genetic testing was a huge relief - we could finally put a more definitive name to her experience.</p><p>Colette is nonverbal but does use a combination of echolalia, gestures, sign language, and a speech app on her iPad to communicate. Luckily, she successfully controls her absence seizures with medication. Colette has a stubborn streak and thrives in familiar environments like many other kids we’ve learned about.</p><p>Physically, Colette has the low muscle tone and lack of coordination you might expect. Her pain tolerance is through the roof! She has broken her arm, split her forehead open, and taken countless tumbles over the years but we’re hard-pressed to remember a single time she has cried from pain. Tough doesn’t even begin to describe her.</p><p>Colette spends a lot of time in her many therapies: OT, speech, HAB, music, equine, and the list goes on. We’ve learned to celebrate her progress every step of the way. What might seem small to a “typical” family is often an enormous achievement for her.</p><p>Despite her challenges, Colette is a good-natured kid. She enjoys spending time with her family and can be incredibly affectionate, especially with her brother (even if he’d rather her not sometimes!). She’s very friendly with all of her therapists, teachers, and friends. She loves music, movies, and rollercoasters.</p><p>Thanks for reading about our kiddo - we’ve enjoyed reading about all of yours.<br>.</p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Devin had a difficult entry into this world but after 10 days in the NICU she was sent home with a clean bill of health.&nbsp; Unfortunately by three months of age I realize something was just not right and then we saw her first seizure.&nbsp; From there it was a noticeable delay and behavior issues but no one could tell us what was wrong and gave us a diagnosis of Globally Developmentally Delayed with Epilepsy.&nbsp; We got her as much help as we could and never used her diagnosis as a crutch. When her sister DeAna came we were nervous but she has now become the big sister.&nbsp; Devin is a fun loving child who enjoys dressing up in costumes.&nbsp; She loves school and her speech has improved tremendously she can also read which is amazing. She joined her schools cheerleading team which was a highlight and gave her a lot of confidence.&nbsp; Finally at 16 in June of 2019, we got her SynGAP diagnosis which definitely fit the bill.&nbsp; So lucky to have found a community of friends that we can share our experiences with.&nbsp; Devin is an amazing child and everyone who meets her is lucky.</p><p><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Eleanor was born on June 21, 2012, we received a Syngap1 diagnosis August of 2016. After many recommendations and a grant, we were able to get Eleanor tested at Children’s Hospital in St. Paul, MN. (Actually the National Syngap Awareness Day happens to be her birthday)</p><p>We live in Maplewood, MN and have a lot of support around us. Eleanor has never been diagnosed with Epilepsy or Autism. She is non-verbal and uses a communication device at home, for therapies and school. She also knows some signs and is very social.</p><p>Eleanor loves anything Disney, especially the Disney princesses and Blippi, a youtube star:) She is definitely an outdoor girl, and loves to find the beauty in nature. She loves flying and we recently took trips to both Disney World and the Gulf of Mexico. At home, Eleanor likes to ride her scooter, do chalk art with mommy, and just recently learned to pedal on her super cool pink bike!</p><p>The biggest challenges for Eleanor are communicating feelings and learning how to do this without getting upset. Goodbyes are always hard. She perseveres at many things that are challenging to her, and her giggles and smiles light up our lives. We are so proud of Eleanor and know she was made especially for us. She definitely is a Syngap Warrior!</p><p><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Eli was diagnosed with Syngap1 at 2 years old. We started to notice he was developing slower than his peers around age 1. Eli had yet to start talking or babbling much at all and was very unsteady and unable to walk. Seizures began right before his 2nd birthday.</p><p>Eli is nonverbal but he has started to babble a lot more. He tries really hard to talk now so we are hoping with continued speech therapy we will start to hear more words. Eli can sign up to 40+ words! Along with speech therapy, he also attends PT and OT weekly.</p><p>Eli loves music, animals, and spending time outdoors. He really loves to visit his grandparents farms and get rides on the tractor and 4wheeler. Eli has 2 older brothers that adore him and are big helpers. Eli has the best smile, laugh, and dance moves!</p><p> - Mom</p><p><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Elisabet was born in March, 2015 as a healthy baby. She ate, slept, and smiled a lot! Life was not perfect, it was more than that.</p><p>After about 6 months, her development slowed down in every aspect. After her 1st birthday a lot of tests were done to try and figure exactly what was the cause. None of the tests showed any cause or reason. But we already knew that time is moving more quickly than her development. We made peace with the fact that our little fairy will be different.</p><p>A few weeks before her 3rd birthday we got an answer, Syngap1. Elisabet has intellectual disorder, severe epilespy, autism, gait difficulties, and is non-verbal. The hardest thing for Elisabet is learning communication. The combination of intellectual disorder and epilepsy make for a tricky combination. Also it’s often difficult to go even for a short walk or do some outside activities because she simply likes being indoors best. Elisabet can make it pretty impossible to walk with her if she doesn’t want to walk </p><p>Despite the differences and difficulties her special needs cause, we as a family do everything for her. But we have tried to keep it balanced. Everyone in our family is important and needs to have a nice daily life and enough support and attention from both parents. Elisabet has an older brother (Oskar) and a younger sister (Marta).</p><p>We have hard days, and hard hours. We are constantly worrying about Elisabet’s epilepsy. But despite all the worry we try to have as much fun as we can.</p><p>While being a warrior this Wednesday, Elisabet and other Syngap kids/families are in war every other day of the week too. Asking for donations and sharing your most personal story is never easy, but its my duty to help my daughter and others like her as they can’t fight for themselves. I’m proud to do it and I am proud to keep Estonia on the map.<br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>She was diagnosed with SYNGAP1 around age 6, after years of genetic testing. She was born healthy but began showing signs of developmental delay from about 6 months old. She didn't crawl, eat solids or babble like other kids. She began early intervention and various therapies from age 1. She has been in a special education program since age 3, which is around the time her petit mal seizures began. Her early diagnosis was hypotonia, developmental delay, gross motor delay and epilepsy among many others. Today she goes to school, has private speech therapy 2x a week and in-home ABA support 2x a week. She loves her teachers and is one of the hardest working girls we know. Her 7th grade year was a little rough, as she is transitioning from a young girl to teenager. Thankfully she is verbal and can communicate basic needs, although writing and complex motor activities are still difficult for her. She loves using devices, typing, and listening to music on YouTube. Although many things are difficult for her, she is a happy girl who is eager to learn and loves her family.</p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Elise is 6 years old and the younger sister of Syngap siblings. We were already raising a 2 year old Syngapian (undiagnosed at the time) so when Elise started developing the same as older sister Lily, we were familiar with the journey. As soon as Elise had her first seizure at 2.5 years old we started to hunt for a genetic diagnosis and our \"why?\" We have carried on through the years with PT, OT, Speech, feeding therapy, etc (all times 2!). Elise is one of the most social and empathetic little girls I have ever met. Her biggest challenge for a long time was communication and through many years of hard work she is able to communicate most of her needs through some verbal approximations, touchchat, and signs. Elise loves to swim, ride bikes, play with her dolls and play with her fellow kindergarten friends.</p><p> - Mom of <a href=\"http://syngapresearchfund.org/warriors/lily\" target=\"_blank\">Lily</a> &amp;&nbsp;Elise</p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Elsie is from Greenville, South Carolina and was diagnosed with SYNGAP1 in July of 2020. She will be 3 years old in May (2021). She does not currently have an epilepsy or autism diagnosis, but we are continuing to monitor and evaluate for both. </p><p>We first noticed delays before Elsie’s first birthday. She was not crawling, talking, or walking and was not interested in solid foods. Elsie was diagnosed with global development delays and failure to thrive and began PT, OT, Speech, and Feeding therapy just after her first birthday. In the search for an answer to these delays, various lab tests were performed, all coming back normal. We were referred to an endocrinologist for further testing as well as a neurologist where Elsie was given a brain MRI. All normal results. We were then referred to genetics where Elsie was given Chromosomal Microarray testing, results still coming back without an answer. Finally, through Whole Exome Sequencing, we found that Elsie has a genetic mutation on the SYNGAP1 gene. With this result came both relief for an answer and immense grief of what the future holds for Elsie. </p><p>Each day is a challenge with SYNGAP1, but with these challenges comes tremendous joy. We have truly learned to celebrate the small things. We celebrate Elsie’s milestones in her own timing. Elsie is currently able to walk short distances with assistance, she is working hard to learn to walk independently. She is not yet able to speak, has poor coordination, and still struggles with eating. Elsie loves to swing, go for walks in her stroller, she loves bath time, books, her big sister, Ivy, and watching her favorite shows. Elsie is affectionate, loves big squeezy hugs, she can be silly and loves to giggle. </p><p>We have big hope that we can work towards finding a treatment for SYNGAP1 in her lifetime to improve her quality of life. We are so very grateful to have found a community of support from other SynGAP parents. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Emma was diagnosed with Syngap1 in September 2019. Out of all my kids, she was absolutely the easiest as a baby. Emma started sleeping through the night at one week old and was so happy all the time. She was slow at hitting milestones so we had her tested for Autism at 20 months old. They told us they felt her delay was genetic (not autism related) so we did further testing and found she had a micro duplication of chromosome 5. That left us with many unanswered questions.</p><p>As she has gotten older, things have gotten harder. At 2, Emma was diagnosed with epilepsy. She suffers from many types of seizures. Currently, they are under control with medication. Emma started having sleeping issues at the age of 4. She needs to take several meds to help with that, but she still sometimes struggles with sleep. Her obsessive, compulsive, and aggressive behaviors started really becoming problematic at age 6. They have only worsened since.</p><p>Emma was re tested, and was finally diagnosed with Autism as well. Lately she has been doing anything she can to run away. She has to constantly be watched. She is globally delayed and nonverbal. She also has hypotonia, sensory processing disorder, very high pain tolerance, and still in diapers. Emma uses sign language and pictures to communicate. She has one word - “bye-bye”.</p><p>When Emma has good days, she has a smile that can light up a room. She loves being cuddled and kissed. I know everyone falls in love with her when they meet her. Her laughter is contagious, I love hearing her sweet voice. She loves riding across bridges, jumping on the trampoline, watching Bubble Guppies, and anything to do with water. We finally felt like the Syngap diagnosis gave us some much needed answers. We pray one day they can find a treatment that can help her and all of the others diagnosed.</p><p> - Mom</p><p><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Emmitt is the third of three brothers. His name, respectively, means “whole/complete\" and \"happy\" (in Zulu) and we are determined as a family to help him live up to both of them despite a challenging diagnosis. Around nine months we really began to realize that Emmitt was not just a laid back baby, but that he was developmentally far behind where his brothers were at that age. He was diagnosed with epilepsy at 16 months, though we suspect he was having seizures since around nine months, but that they were very barely noticeable. Seizure control remains one of our biggest challenges at the moment. Emmitt will be 2 in November and is beginning to take some independent steps, identifying some basics shapes and animals, and always showing us that he understands more than he can express. No understandable words yet, but he has something to say about everything and loves to have people use prompts for different words on his face.</p><p>We have found living in South Africa (as Americans) to be a challenge with access to different types of therapies, knowledgeable neurologists, and being far from family and our usual support structures. On the whole, our South African friends have been very understanding of our situation and have shown tons of love and compassion towards Emmitt. Disability is seen different here than in other parts of the world, and, in some ways, we are grateful for that. One of the daily issues we face is that many places we go are a sensory overload, packed with people, many different smells and always lots of noise. It can be a bit overwhelming for anyone who is not used to it, let alone someone with Syngap. Without a doubt, our two older boys are one of the biggest assets to Emmitt's development and character. They love him for who he is and enjoy getting wild and crazy with him on our trampoline. Now that we have a diagnosis, we are constantly looking for ways to improve his life and to make sure he meets his full potential.</p><p><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Enzo’s arrival into our family was cause for great joy. Until the first 3 months of his life everything happened as expected. Enzo was breastfeeding very well and everything was in normal range. At 4 months old he was diagnosed with nystagmus and strabismus and then quickly was given glasses. He was able to sit at 10 months, started crawling at 12 months, and then walked at 18 months of age. When it was time to start eating solid foods he refused and would only take a bottle. He would wake up every 2 hours asking for his bottle. When he was in daycare we got a call saying that while all of the other children took naps, the only one who did not sleep was Enzo. <br></p><p>In November of 2014, Enzo had his first seizure.Suddenly he rolled his eyes with quick blinks and fell backwards like a disconnected robot. We are still trying to figure out the magic dosage to keep his seizures completely under control. Although we had success with valproic acid in the mix, we had to slowly wean off as he started to have heavy bruising and balance issues. <br></p><p>It has been a journey with Enzo as his mood and temperament has changed significantly over time. Currently he is on keppra but we have lost our once happy child. Prior to this critical period, he was filled with happiness and laughter. Enzo would fight for everyone’s affection, mostly loving big hugs. He has always been very fond of instruments and any video that has music. Enzo will bring my fingers towards a guitar as he knows that is what needs to be done to make music. We love our Enzo, our warrior, very much. </p><p><br><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Erich is a beautiful boy who is about to turn 4. He is our little alarm clock, making sure we rise and shine nice and early. More than anything, Erich loves attention and to make people happy. Often, he is more interested in a persons’ response than completing the actual task at hand. Everyday, he works very hard in his therapies and at school. He loves to eat ice-cream and to be outside walking around and looking for trucks and tires. He also enjoys swimming, hanging out in his Thomas the Train tent, swinging and climbing. He is starting to explore different drawers in the kitchen and other rooms, looking for interesting things to put in his mouth. He also enjoys riding horses and playing hide and seek. His absolute favorite thing to do is snuggle with mama and papa to watch Stinky and Dirty on Amazon prime. We are waiting for the next season in great anticipation. We hope that Erich will be able to communicate his needs and remain happy and alert. Ultimately, we are always hopeful for a treatment to increase his Syngap protein production levels.</p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Looking back, one of the first things we noticed about Fallyn was that she didn’t like to put weight on her legs as a baby. &nbsp;She was late to sit up, late to crawl, and gagged when we started introducing baby food at 6 months. &nbsp;As a baby, she rolled around the room to get to something she wanted. When she hadn’t started crawling by 12 months we got her enrolled in some therapy. &nbsp;It was also around 10-12 months we noticed she started to wave her hands in front of her face and she started to have an eye turn. Fallyn took her first steps around 18 months old. &nbsp;Because of her low tone she wasn’t the most steady and it took quit a while for her balance to improve and for her to gain independence. &nbsp;Around 19 months she got her first pair of glasses and around &nbsp;27 months she had bilateral strabismus surgery. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Once we &nbsp;introduced thicker puréed foods and worked with speech therapy we saw improvements in her swallowing. &nbsp;We do notice she still tends to overfill her mouth and doesn’t always chew her food long enough so we are careful to make sure she has foods cut up small enough. &nbsp;After we took away her baby bottle with milk in it she started to only want to drink water. &nbsp;She refuses any milk, juice, or flavored drinks unless it is a smoothie. &nbsp; &nbsp;Fallyn has dealt with constipation and gas issues from the moment I quit breastfeeding (3 months old). &nbsp;We did several doctor visits and tested for different allergies/intolerances but could never come up with any answers until we got her syngap diagnosis. </p><p>As a baby Fallyn actually slept fairly well. It was around 2.5 years when we started to have difficulty with her waking around 2-3am completely distraught and staying up for the rest of the night. &nbsp;After doing a sleep study we did find moderate sleep apnea. &nbsp;She had her tonsils and adenoids removed around 5 years. &nbsp;During the same surgery they corrected a lip and &nbsp;posterior tongue tie. We didn’t realize she had the ties until it was pointed out by one of her speech therapist. &nbsp;After her surgery we did feel we saw a large improvement in her sleep as well as her eating. &nbsp;On occasion she still wakes in the the night but it seems to be worse if she is sick. &nbsp;</p><p>Fallyn started to have staring spells around 2yrs and had a 2 hour eeg and mri at that time, which were considered normal. &nbsp; Fallyn saw a geneticist around 3 years who did a chromosome micro array, which did not give us any answers. &nbsp;After pushing a little bit harder for answers and getting a referral to a geneticist in Minneapolis, we were finally given the answer we thought we would never find. &nbsp;Fallyn's diagnosis came in December 2019, after getting results from whole exome sequencing. &nbsp;We have since had a 5 hr eeg which did not show any seizures at the time. &nbsp;She does not have any epilepsy diagnosis or autism diagnosis at this time. &nbsp;We have not noticed any obvious seizures but we have seen some episodes of staring, eye movements, behaviors when eating, &nbsp;that have made us question a second opinion or longer EEG. </p><p>Fallyn's first few words started around 2 -3 years old. &nbsp;She usually only says one word at a time and her receptive ability is much greater than her verbal ability. &nbsp;She has an easier time copying words then coming up with the speech herself. Fallyns knows her ABCs , colors, and some numbers. Fallyn struggles with understanding abstract concepts. Fallyn goes to kindergarten at a local public school and has an EIP with speech, OT, pt, and special Ed services. &nbsp;We are currently looking into possibility of ABA services or therapies to help with behaviors as we have seen an increase in behaviors this past year (hair pulling, biting self, throwing). &nbsp;Most of Fallyns behaviors are self injurious but on occasion she lashes out at family or people with whom she is comfortable. Fallyn has always had different sensory issues- auditory, tactile, oral. </p><p>She absolutely loves water, music, babies, outdoors, animals, the trampoline, &nbsp;baking, and YouTube. &nbsp;She has the biggest smile and her laugh is infectious. &nbsp;Fallyn thrives best on praise and positive reinforcement. &nbsp;Fallyn has one sibling, Mylah, who is two years younger. &nbsp;Although some days can be trying, they have quite a special bond and really do love each other. &nbsp;Fallyn can be very silly at times and she can also be very loving! &nbsp;At times she can be shy. &nbsp;She likes to watch people. When she does talk, she wants you to repeat and acknowledge what she said! </p><p>We are so greatful to have found the syngap community. We hope that with targeted therapies and a greater understanding of her struggles we can give her her best quality of life. &nbsp;It is so helpful to read what has and has not worked for different families and how to prepare for the future. &nbsp;We are hopeful for the future and the medical advances that we may see in Fallyn's lifetime! </p><p><br><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>When he was 4 years old, we learned he was intellectually disabled and autistic. In 2011, Francis was diagnosed at the age of 15 by Dr. Jacques Michaud. We never dreamed that we would one day discover the cause of his condition. Francis has not displayed any signs of having seizures. For our son, behaviors are the most challenging.</p><p>Before the age of 13, Francis was hospitalized twice in a mental hospital due to aggressive behaviors. At the age of 13, we found a special home for him that could cater to his needs to the fullest. Putting Francis into a home was the hardest decision of our families lives. As a mother it broke my heart immensely to do so. But life has it’s way to make you slowly stronger.</p><p>Now Francis comes home every other weekend and is still greatly attached to his family. We are still a very strong family unit. Francis has an older sister (age 25) who has become a special needs teacher. He has impacted all of our lives in a positive way and taught us many things along the way.<br></p><p>- Chantal (Mom)</p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>“Gabriele was diagnosed with Syngap1 at 2.5 years old at the Meyer Hospital in Florence. Around 2 years old we noticed Gabriele having myoclonic absence seizures. Following this discovery we went to various specialists and eventually had a genetic test done that gave us the diagnosis. We are struggling with Gabriele feeling tired and being unable to administer food properly to him. Hopefully soon we can get help for that.</p><p>Gabriele is a very sweet child and loves cuddles. We deal with his frustrations due to his lack of communication skills, often he will hit himself on the head when he can’t get what he wants. We are still hopeful that one day he will be able to communicate with us in some way.” -Dad</p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>The best word to describe Hannah is silly. She's a funny, curious, stubborn, impulsive and playful 3½ year old. We started noticing delays around 4-5 months old and thought she may have Cerebral Palsy. It wasn’t until age 2½ that Hannah was finally diagnosed with a mosaic form of SYNGAP1 via Ambry Genetics Neurodevelopment expanded panel. Mosaic means some of her cells are healthy and some have the “de novo” SYNGAP1 mutation. Her doctors say mosaicism probably explains why she can talk and we hope it may offer protection against developing epilepsy. A month prior to Hannah’s SYNGAP1 genetic diagnosis she was diagnosed with ASD, speech delay, and gross motor delay.</p><p>Hannah loves music, reading, swimming, playdough, bubbles, sand, and board games. Her favourite foods are cupcakes, pine nuts and ice lollies. Hannah would live in the park if she could and can now swing on the “big girl” swings. She also loves the supermarket.</p><p>Hannah knows her alphabet, numbers, animals, colours, shapes and some American Sign Language. She’s starting to “read” by herself and loves Pete the Cat and Stanley books. Hannah’s visual recall is really good. Pre-COVID Hannah was able to spot her favourite book in a crowded library by glimpsing a tiny part of the spine.</p><p>Hannah sometimes refers to herself and other people as “bear.” We have no idea why!</p><p>Hannah has a little brother “Al”. She doesn’t interact with him much but likes to rub his hair and say “don’t do that, bear!” when he’s getting into mischief.</p><p>Hannah struggles to understand abstract concepts like me/you, past/present and danger. Playing with other children and pretend play is also challenging. Hannah prefers predictable interactions and will say the same jokes and phrases every day. Hannah’s attention span is limited and she needs lots of time to process a question. We are thankful that Hannah now sleeps quite well, generally all night and a 2-3 hour nap daily.</p><p>Hannah attends a wonderful developmental preschool and receives OT, PT, and Speech three times a week each at school. Having a SYNGAP1 diagnosis helps inform the best way to manage her care. We hope in the future SYNGAP1 will be tested for at birth and gene-specific therapies will be found to help mitigate the serious challenges the children face.&nbsp;</p><p>-Jessica, Mom<br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Harper was diagnosed with SynGAP1 May 2018, and shortly after Epilepsy. She has 2 older sisters and 1 little brother who all adore her! She is the sweetest little girl and a great sister. She is in speech, PT, occupational and music therapy. Her receptive language is almost right on target for her age but her expressive language is far behind. She has about 35 signs she uses throughout her day to communicate and also uses an AAC device at school. She loves to sing, dance, and making people smile! Harper’s biggest daily struggles with SynGAP1 are epilepsy, verbal communication, gross and fine motor delays. We are so hopeful for a cure so she can lead a life like her siblings.</p><p> - Jen, Mom</p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Helena is our very active and determined little girl. She is aged 8 and was diagnosed with Syngap in October 2017, aged 5. She lives with mum, dad and her older brother and younger sister in England.</p><p>She was a relatively placid young baby, but we were alerted to potential problems at around 9 months old when she still couldn’t sit up unsupported and a physio was concerned about her muscle tone; after a number of trips to the paediatrician and with major milestones being missed, we received the Global development delay diagnosis. We had a brain MRI and some basic genetic tests done but were then placed onto the national DDD (Deciphering Developmental Disorders) genetic study and over three years later we received the Syngap1 diagnosis.</p><p>Helena now has the Syngap1 diagnosis alongside ASD, ADHD, severe learning difficulties, epilepsy, hypermobility, oppositional defiance disorder, early on-set puberty and sensory processing issues, amongst other things. Her epilepsy presents mildly at the moment, for which we are thankful.</p><p>Helena loves water, especially swimming and having baths, baking, eating ice-cream, face-painting, slides, swings and, most recently, she likes looking at a collection of garden gnomes outside a house round the corner. She of course likes her iPad and “daddy’s phone” where she likes to watch videos and listen to music; current favourites are Paw Patrol, Christmas songs and electronic dance.&nbsp;</p><p>Helena has some extremely challenging behaviours which we continue to try to understand so that we can help her more. Her aggression towards loved ones and her defiance are at best testing, seeing her hit and bite her younger sister is as heart-breaking as it is unfathomable. How our little warrior suffers inside is hard to imagine.</p><p>These behaviours severely impact our family life, our relationships, our work and our passions and dreams, but we have gained so much from the Syngap community and we hope to be able to help other families who are on this journey with us.<br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Ilona is a fun loving girl full of love for music, animals and her family! When she smiles, we all smile. Ilona was one of the first in the world to receive a Syngap1 diagnosis in early 2011. The diagnosis gave us the answer we had been looking for on our what seemed like endless collection of clinical symptoms; autism, epilepsy, intellectual disability, sensory processing disorder, dyspraxia, ataxia, sleep disorder, eating disorder etc.<br>Ilona has this amazing ability to change people around her, she teaches us daily how to live in the moment, how to enjoy the smallest things and how to love without any limit. Ilona is not able to talk to us verbally but she communicates her love loud and clear.<br>Our biggest wish is to be able to advance research in an effort to improve her and other Syngap kids and adults quality of life. We hope to be able to continue showing her the world and we want her to be part of her community to the fullest.</p><p>- Reetta, Mom</p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Isabella was given a Syngap1 diagnosis in March of this year. She was first diagnosed with epilepsy at about 18 months. Our first clue something was off was a delay in walking despite being quite strong. I kept asking her pediatrician and he would say, “She’s a redhead, they are stubborn.” Then she started having eye rolls and flutters when she was eating. She would choke on her food.</p><p>We have tried so many meds, the ketogenic diet, and&nbsp; CBD oil. Bella was also diagnosed with Paroxysmal Tonic Upgaze, but never really treated for that as most doctors and neurologists don’t know much about it.</p><p>The neurologists kept telling us they thought she had a syndrome that hadn’t been discovered.</p><p>She has had speech therapy, occupational therapy and physical therapy off and on since her diagnosis of epilepsy. When we read the symptoms of Syngap 1 it was almost like reading a diary of her life!</p><p>Bella loves music, swimming, swinging, baby dolls, watching TV, playing outside, and riding her adaptive bike. You can’t ever go too fast for her. The faster a ride the happiest she is.</p><p>She struggles with sensory issues (SPD), talking and learning. She is very friendly, but can have horrible fits. Her “weird” sensory issue right now is licking (which drives mommy crazy). She doesn’t like transitions but once dressed for example, she is fine. She would live in Under Armour clothes if I let her.&nbsp; She isn’t potty trained which is our number one goal for 2020. She uses some sign language for communication (I was a sign language interpreter before staying home with her full time), some talking and we just got her a communication device.</p><p><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Jaeli Williams is the eldest of 2 Syngap sisters, diagnosed in February 2016. Jaeli loves to dress up, sing and dance her favorite songs, right now it’s “dem bones”. She hums the song and knocks her knees just like her favorite skeleton. Her other passion is swimming. We live in Australia and over our summer, Jaeli swims daily. She swims in the pool and the ocean. Duck diving and holding her breath longer than anyone we know. While Jaeli is friendly, cuddly and giggles often, she becomes overwhelmed and frustrated dealing with her impulses, insomnia, seizures and hyperactivity. Jaeli is happy but we wish she could articulate her needs better.<br>We dream of a day when Jaeli is independent, can advocate for herself and tell us exactly how it feels to be a Super Syngapian.</p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Our sweet boy James just turned 5 years old. He was an easy baby, very passive. We didn't notice any delay until we ended up at BC Children's Hospital for a shaky eye at nine months old. With an unusual diagnosis of Spasmus Nutans in only one eye, we were sent to Neurology. They found some milestone delays and immediately admitted us for a CT scan which came back inconclusive. We had three possibilities at this stage; a brain tumor, cerebral palsy or a ‘1 in a million’ genetic mutation.</p><p>By the age of one we noticed we were missing many milestones; crawling, walking and talking. We had an MRI at this stage which seemed to rule out a brain tumor – this sounds like good news but the remaining options were very daunting. A brain tumor could possibly be treated and he could make a complete recovery,<strong> </strong>but now we were left with cerebral palsy or a genetic mutation. A good friend of the family had mentioned Angelman’s syndrome, as James had the majority of the symptoms.</p><p>We tried to get on a genetics study under a Cerebral Palsy funded program but failed, we didn’t meet the criteria. All the time we were missing more and more milestones. We eventually got on another study and in December 2019 when James was almost 4 we were told the result, Syngap1. We were told there is no treatment, no cure and that any medication would be to treat symptoms like epilepsy. They explained how rare it was and we would be ‘writing the book as we go, for others’.</p><p>At this stage I can’t clearly explain how we felt; probably the strongest feeling was protection toward James. The answers had changed a lot about the future and set our expectations but they didn’t change how we felt about him. We knew James and James knew us. We had to gather our strength and do this. It took most of the following year to absorb the gravity of the diagnosis. A year with COVID and lockdowns, absence of help and therapy.&nbsp;</p><p>So, the light at the end of the tunnel? James!</p><p>James is the sweetest, most gentle, kind, soft person. He tries extremely hard to do things and his determination to push himself is truly amazing. He is such a genuine soul. He will let you know if he likes (or does not!) like something. If James laughs - you absolutely made him laugh. If James touches or cuddles you - he absolutely felt an attraction to you. He is not capable of fake. It is an absolute delight to have such honesty in our lives. I cannot express how much we love him, for him.</p><p>A few days before his 4th birthday he took his first steps. He needs AFO’s to achieve this but it is wonderful! We celebrate his achievements at his pace. A milestone is a milestone and time doesn’t matter. His achievements are real breakthroughs. A few days a year James says “Dad” or “Mom” or what we think is “what’s that” – it sounds like “w sat”. We love hearing his gentle soft voice. We appreciate how much effort it takes his brain to line everything up to speak and know it may be six months until we hear it again.</p><p>Since he started walking about a year ago, we had half rise steps put in our house so he could enjoy more freedom and access more of our house. He has now learned to go up and down those stairs and we think he saw it as a challenge! Syngapians have memory issues and I’m sure that although it takes a while for him to remember something, when he does, he guards those memories as real treasures.</p><p>His favorite place to be is snuggled up with his Dad...cheek to cheek. He is truly a beautiful soul.<br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>He was diagnosed in the age of 2 years. The smile and laugh of this little guy can melt hearts. Jamie loves water, music and watching videos. Especially those of his own adventures. He enjoys his daily visits at his favorite places like the supermarket and the train station. There he practices his motor skills in his wheelchair and his walker. However, what he likes most is being on tour with his family. Whether it’s for a day out and about, a family holiday or traveling to meet other Syngap families. He likes to increase awareness about SYNGAP Elternhilfe, the German patient organization.</p><p>Jamie struggles most with two topics. 1. Transitions, he can’t cope with the ending of fun activities and starting something else. 2. Lack of speech is a huge topic for him as for many other syngapians. Sounds and syllables came and disappeared again. To overcome this, he has an AAC device that helps him to communicate with people around him by the use of symbols.<br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>After many tests and seeing countless specialists, roughly 5 years ago. Jaxon was given the Syngap1 diagnosis. I say roughly because we were only told MRD5, and didn’t realize others in our little rare community referred to it as Syngap.&nbsp;</p><p>Our Jaxon also has non progressive white brain matter loss. He has significant portions that did not develop in the right front and left sides of his brain. Due to this lack of white matter, an arachnoid cyst has developed on the base of his brain and stem. The lack of white brain matter significantly impacts his symptoms of Syngap, or so our neurogeneticist explains. He is non-verbal but gets his points across with either his speech device, simple gestures, or noises (crying, demanding yell, etc). He does have epilepsy with multiple seizure types. These are currently under control with meds. He doesn’t sleep well at all and never has! He has feeding issues and has had to use thickeners for his drinks in the past due to aspiration. We have to monitor his eating closely as he will choke. However, that doesn’t stop him from enjoying his favorite foods: chocolate milk shakes, powdered donuts, fruit cups, Doritos and cheeseburgers, to name a few!</p><p>Despite his health and behavior issues (he can have a bit of a bossy temper) he is a happy kid that is loving and affectionate with his family! He loves his big brothers, Taren-20, and Mason-15. He loves school, playing outside, going to Walmart, McDonald’s, Youtube kids, and throwing rocks at the boat landing on the Wabash River. We live only lives a couple of hours away from Ty, another Syngap Warrior! We visit when we can!</p><p><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Jaxon was diagnosed in Dec. 2015 with Syngap1. After a traumatic birth, he was diagnosed with Pervasive Development Delays (PDD) at 9 months which started his life of therapies. His developmental pediatrician at age 2 wrote, cause of PDD \"genetic or mitochondrial.\" It wasn't until age 3 that Jaxon was diagnosed with epilepsy and autism. Non-speaking, he began using a speaking device at age 5 amazingly able to navigate it. With incredible spatial awareness, he knows where every carousel, car wash, swimming pool and the beach is located. Jaxon loves water, the ocean and surfing. Since age 2, the \"Syngap Snap\" has taken on various forms which recently required a mood stabilizer. ABA therapy has made a tremendous difference with his rigid and challenging behaviors. Now a teenager and in puberty, the perspective on life definitely has changed. Jaxon is a smart, handsome, charmer with an infectious laugh who you cannot help but to fall in love with just ask his therapists.</p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Jocelyn was diagnosed with SynGAP1 in January of 2021. She is nonverbal and does not walk yet. Unfortunately we live in a small town in Kansas and we do not have a lot of resources here which means she has yet to start speech, occupational, feeding, or physical therapy. </p><p>In October of 2020, her MRI findings showed she was majorly delayed as this was prior to her SynGAP1 diagnosis. In the beginning of November, I started seeing her look like she was sleepy even after she had just woken up. For a while I thought she was just tired until she did it more frequently. Jocelyn would stand in her crib and then just drop. Of course after noticing this, I did some of my own research and decided she was most likely having seizures. I called her neurologist and told her what was going on and so we eventually hopped into the car for an 8 hour drive to Kansas City to Children's Mercy Hospital. After an EEG, she was diagnosed with epilepsy. Jocelyn suffers from drop seizures. </p><p>We are thankful to currently have Jocelyn’s seizures under control. Next we are hoping to find a way to get all the different therapies she is in need of. </p><p>Overall, Jocelyn is a very happy little girl. Her smiles and laughter just make me so much stronger and know that I have to keep fighting to get the help that she needs. She loves being outside, going for car rides, and being with her older siblings. Jocelyn does crawl and can get up and down from the couch. I try my best to walk with her around the house as much as I can as she needs full assistance. Her sleep schedule changes every 3-6 days. As she has minimal communication skills we have to guess when she is hungry, needs changing, etc. I hope that one day she will be better able to communicate her needs with me. </p><p>I love my precious daughter very much and I hope to find out more about Syngap1 as we are only at the start of our diagnosis journey. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Kailyn, Kai for short, was diagnosed with SynGAP1 in December 2019 at the age of 4. Although getting the diagnosis was difficult news to grasp, it also provided relief in the sense that we now had the answer to what causes her symptoms. After her first birthday, Kai started having extensive meltdowns as well as compulsive aggressive and intense self-injurious behavior. Soon after, she began having what we now know are myoclonic seizures. At 3.5 she was diagnosed with generalized epilepsy. Her events are classified as myoclonic and atonic. Up until recently, she suffered ~200 episodes daily. After lots of tinkering with medication, her clinical seizures have subsided; only just in the last several weeks. We are cautiously ecstatic! Kai is also diagnosed with autism, severe apraxia, and global delay as well as being faced with hypotonia and ataxia.</p><p>We recently celebrated Kai’s 5th birthday! Despite her challenges, Kai is fun-loving and has a magnetic personality. She LOVES activities involving lots of sensory input including water and swimming, sand, and loud music/musical instruments. She is thrilled by the lawn mower, motorcycle, airplanes, and other construction vehicles. What Kailyn lacks in verbal communication she makes up for with dramatic facial expressions, endless high-fives, and a captivating smile.</p><p>Although Kai will continue to face obstacles surrounding her speech, coordination/strength, and behavior, we are incredibly hopeful to see what the future holds for her and all of our precious Syngapians.<br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Our daughter Kasia is the most funny and adventurous kid. She is curious like no other; she loves music, dance and electronics are her favorites. She also loves water and is a pretty good swimmer. Kasia could spend all day outdoors playing with plants, feeling the wind and just exploring the surroundings. </p><p>Kasia has a rare genetic mutation called Syngap1. She was diagnosed in October 2020 after three years of searching for a reason for her developmental delays. She was born a seemingly healthy baby, it wasn’t until 6 months her eyes started shaking and she was diagnosed with nystagmus. We also noticed a gross motor delay and started testing. She had brain scans, evaluations, and everything was coming back normal. We started physical therapy. She crawled at 14 months and started independently walking at 2 years, 4 months. She was delayed but we were hoping she would catch up. At 16 months we added speech, occupational and feeding therapies. </p><p>At 3 years old--when she still wasn’t speaking--we took her to a geneticist. Diagnosis gave us a road map to her medical condition and soon after we learned that she is having frequent seizures, we just didn’t recognize them. We also gained a support group of friends with children with the same diagnosis, which was and is a lifeline for us. When you are a parent and you learn that your child is very ill with a rare disease you think that there is no hope, no one will care. The incredible parents of SRF gave us realistic expectations, hope for treatment/cure and a chance for our Kasia to have a life we all want for her. We believe in her and I hope the world will too.</p>"

She has limited speech, on her best days she says around 8 words. She has obsessions that can lead to extreme frustration. If she is on her iPad (watching ambulances or blippi) and it suddenly switches off she will go into a rage. Kimberley has a high pain tolerance. She has no danger awareness so she has to have 1:1 care at all times. She thrives from routine and familiar settings, shows aggressive outbursts when there is change. Currently she is showing absence and myoclonic seizures but we are currently waiting on an EEG for further testing.<br></p><p>She attends a Special Educational Needs (SEN) school which she loves going to. Kimberley loves music ,dancing ,horse riding, being outside whatever the weather. Most of all, she loves water, a true Syngapian.<br></p><p>Kimberley is the most determined little girl I know, she can be very affectionate and happy. We all love her so very much.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Having a SYNGAP1 diagnosis was tough to hear but we have the best support from other families like ours were a huge SYNGAP1 family I don’t know where we’d be without them.<br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Kyle was diagnosed with SYNGAP1 in July of 2020. We honestly didn't think we would ever receive a diagnosis that would explain all of Kyle's symptoms. He had had several genetic tests (with negative results) when he was younger, but SYNGAP1 had only been discovered when Kyle was just three years old, so he was never tested for this genetic disorder until last summer, when his neurologist and geneticist suggested that we test again. Kyle has hypotonia and didn't walk independently until he was 3 years old. He is nonverbal, but uses a few signs as well as a Speech Generating Device, to communicate basic needs and wants. He is not yet potty trained, but we are currently working hard on teaching him. Kyle has atonic seizures and the onset of his epilepsy was just before his 2nd Birthday. Kyle has had speech, occupational, and physical therapies since he was a few months old. He has also participated in Hippotheraphy, which he loved. He attends a private school for children with special needs where ABA Therapy is used. Kyle loves to look at books, loves attention and cuddling, has an amazing memory, and the most contagious laughter!&nbsp;<br></p><p>We love spending time together, but the focus tends to need to be on our Syngapian in order for all of us to have a good time! Kyle loves swimming, going to playgrounds, and taking rides on elevators and on our golf cart. He also loves covered bridges, so our family has visited quite a few in our area. When Kyle is doing any of these things, he experiences pure joy.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Kyle needs full assistance and care 24/7 and, at times, my husband and I are overwhelmed, emotionally, not sure of what his future will look like. We hope that he continues to progress with his speech device so that he can communicate even more with us. We are excited to finally have a diagnosis so that we can connect with other Syngap families and learn from them, but also to help other families who have children who are younger and recently diagnosed.&nbsp;<br></p><p>I would tell newly diagnosed families to connect with others who have children with Syngap for support and hope, and advice on various things (such as potty training, communication, therapies, etc.) I would tell them that their life is going to have challenges and difficulties, but also much joy and happiness. If they not only focus on their child and the support he or she needs, but also to focus on themselves and get the support they need as the parents and caregivers of their Syngapian.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Kyle’s mother Kelli has a wonderful website where she writes and shares videos of Kyle to encourage other parents and remind them that they are not alone: <a href=\"http://www.KelliMcIntosh.com\">KelliMcIntosh.com</a></p><p>Kelli has also been sharing videos about her son which we urge you to watch: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkuUMttDLfk\" target=\"_blank\">What is Syngap1?</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO_5904e54M\" target=\"_blank\">SYNGAP1 Morning Routine</a>.<br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>She was diagnosed April 1st 2020 after 2 long years of advocating for genetic testing. We were told so many times not to expect any findings, and that we may never know what was causing Laila’s&nbsp; developmental delays. We knew there had to be an answer and we are thankful to finally know why Laila is Laila, and to also have a sense of community; we feel truly thankful to be able to connect with other SYNGAP families.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We noticed Laila was not meeting some milestones around 4 months, and by 6 months she was obviously behind. Most notably, Lailas' fine motor skills were non-existent and she was not able to hold anything in her hands or bring toys to her mouth as babies typically do. Around 7 months we noticed peculiar head dropping episodes that looked like infantile spasm seizures. She had her first EEG at Sick Kids hospital in Toronto at 7 months old. Infantile spasms were ruled out, but Laila has been followed by neurology ever since. She had her most recent EEG in July 2020 and while Laila has not ever had a seizure that we know of, we were told there is a propensity for seizures later on and she will continue to be monitored closely.&nbsp;</p><p>Laila began receiving PT, OT and speech therapy starting at 4 months old and currently is also enrolled in an IBI program for behavior where she receives 20 hours of therapy a week. She also attends a city daycare 2 days a week to give her an opportunity to play with other children. Laila’s social skills have always been a strength of hers. She has formed strong friendships with the educators and children. Laila’s biggest challenges are motor planning and aggression. She has a very strong desire to communicate and is very frustrated by her body not cooperating with her! She has approx 10 words and uses 10 different signs (her favorites are \"more\" and \"sorry\"), but the PECS system was introduced at IBI and she has almost 100 images in her book that she uses regularly!&nbsp;</p><p>Laila is mischievous, cheeky, cuddly and sensitive. She is persistent, wildly adventurous and yet very shy. Laila has an older sister, Samia, who she adores and tries her hardest to copy. She follows her everywhere and can always be pulled out of a bad mood by her sister! Like a lot of Syngapians, Laila loves water. She can be known to have multiple baths a day and absolutely loves swimming. In the cold Canadian winters Laila can be found sitting by the fireplace for hours, she is obsessed with heat. Laila loves car rides, rolling in the leaves in the fall, being pulled around in her wagon and swinging on her swing. She is very picky about what TV shows or movies are on and she is the queen of the remote in our house, although she hasn't figured out how to work it just yet.&nbsp;</p><p>The best piece of advice we were given upon finding out that Laila has SYNGAP1 was this: \"don't let her diagnosis overshadow her potential.\" Set goals and go after them! Laila has accomplished so much, made so many strides and done so many things we thought she may never do already. She will show us what she can do! Our biggest dream is that there is eventually a treatment discovered for SYNGAP1 and we will never give up hope that one is found in Laila’s lifetime. <br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Laré was first diagnosed with severe non-verbal autism in 2002. Two years later the diagnosis of epilepsy came, the milestones were difficult to reach and she does not speak. She uses sign language, PECS, or her talker. She has severe sleep disorders and other special needs.</p><p>She loves Disney, Paw Patrol, Peppa pig, and stuffed animals.</p><p>For years I thought that she \"only\" has the combination of autism / epilepsy / sleep disorders. But in December 2019, when we were in an epilepsy clinic, we got the results: Syngap 1. It is a great relief to know exactly what Laré has. You can learn more about Laré by following her insta @severe_autism_princess” </p><p>- Mom<br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Hello everyone, my name is Lars Punt I am 3.5 years old and I am from the Netherlands. Two weeks ago you were able to read my brother's story and now it's my turn.</p><p>Since I was 1.5 years old I knew that I have syngap1 just like my brother (Nick). Although we are identical twins, we are still different. But with many things we look alike and we are the same in our development. My biggest challenge is food. I have had a PEG probe for over a year. It helps me to get enough food and drink. Even though I don't feel like eating. Just like my brother, I have epilepsy. You will not see it because the epilepsy is under control with my medication.</p><p>I talk to everyone a lot. But I don't get understood. But that is because I make many sounds instead of words. We do have some resources to start communicating, but I don't understand a thing. Instead I make everyone laugh and then I have a lot of fun too.</p><p>Furthermore, I am not in a hurry to develop. I can crawl a little but then I will stop. I still have a nice wheelchair where my mom and dad can transport me. It also fits in our beautiful new bus. But I also get a nice walker and a standing table. With that, I learn to stand and maybe walk. But I have more difficulty with that than my brother.</p><p>We are very happy with all these tools, but they take up a lot of space. My mom and dad are busy making our house even bigger. And then my brother and I will get a nice bedroom on the ground floor. And a bathtub in the bathroom. Because I don't like a shower at all. A shower makes me completely overwhelmed and then I scream. With a lot of practice I think the bath is ok. As long as they don't wet my hair or face.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed my story and my brother's. If you want to see or hear us more often, you can check out our blog on Facebook “Syngap Twins\"<br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>The older sibling of Syngap sisters! At about 6-9 months old, we started noticing she wasn't hitting any of her milestones and we started with early intervention. Lily started sitting unsupported around 18 months, she crawled at 2 years, and walked at 2.5 years old. She was diagnosed with epilepsy just before age 3 and has gone through multiple medication changes to get her seizures under control. Lily has never verbally spoken a word and doesn't have the gross motor planning to sign. She communicates using a device with LAMP and with her many facial expressions and gestures. Lily has a smile as bright as the sun and shows her love with the biggest bear hugs and puckered up kisses. Lily loves water and roller coasters! She just started swimming for our local special olympics swim team and we couldn't be more proud. Lily is one determined little girl and always rises above her daily challenges!</p><p> - Mom of Lily &amp;&nbsp;Elise</p><p><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Logan is a twin, he and Danny were healthy babies born full term in Week 40. While Logan was the first to turn around, Danny progressed much faster on the other milestones. When Logan was 12 months old, he had what seemed to be a neurological event. In October 2019 after several genetic tests, Logan was diagnosed with Syngap1 who responded to his delays.</p><p>Logan is typically a happy kid who loves to be outside jumping on the trampoline (while other kids bounce him), loves being pushed on a swing and taking tractor and road rides. He loves people, especially adults, and is super generous with his hugs. He hasn't met a stranger who doesn't like him. Logan is obsessed with phone calls, FaceTiming and selfie mode. He loves buttons and switches and seeing the resulting effects of seeing the lights on and off or the garage door open and shut. And he loves the attention of his brothers.</p><p>Logan is known in his preschool church and community for his generous hugs, big smile and fun and numerous facial expressions.</p><p>Logan has been in physical therapy, occupational therapy and language therapies since he was one year old. He's come a long way to grab and carry items. Still doesn't run but can walk real fast. She still prefers bottles, but she's learning to eat solid foods. Logan can say some words like ′′ dad ′′ and ′′ baba ′′ (bottle). She babbles a lot, but she's still working to learn how to speak. He gets frustrated when he can't communicate his needs or desires, and that frustration results in shouting and crying. He can definitely understand a lot more than he can articulate.</p><p>Unlike many other Syngapians, Logan is not epileptic and has no autism. He doesn't take any medication.</p><p>Logan brings lots of joy to his family and friends!</p><p>Thanks for reading Logan's story! Check out all our Warrior Wednesday posts.</p>"

She loves playing with her friends at school and her cousins Lilah and Braylee. Along with syngap1 she has also been diagnosed with epilepsy and autism. Right now her biggest challenge is that she is non verbal. She does use some signs to communicate what she wants. She receives ABA, speech, ot &amp; pt. She is a fighter and sees the world in a magical way.

    "Full Story": "<p>Melissa was born full term and hit all of her baby milestones until 9 months old, then she stagnated. She started walking at 18 months, she was not saying “mama” or “dada”. Her pediatrician insisted that everything was fine, all kids develop differently. At 34 months, our pediatrician was finally concerned and advised that Melissa receive Early Intervention. Besides her delayed speech and her occasional hand tremor, there was no hint that she had any other issues. Melissa was lovable, friendly, would play, follow commands, and make great eye contact. At 3 years old, I noticed her eyes flicker one day getting her out of the car. This was the beginning of the journey of her epilepsy diagnosis. Four different neurologists tried to pinpoint what she had, they could not identify an underlying disorder. At age 11, a neurologist diagnosed Melissa with TCS2. which causes Tuberous Sclerosis. Tuberous Sclerosis is a rare disease associated with epilepsy, development delay, and benign tumors. After several rounds of unnecessary medications that only seemed to be making Melissa worse. Finally in mid July of this year, after another genetic test, a diagnosis of SYNGAP1.</p><p>Melissa is strong willed and incredibly strong. Some of Melissa’s quirks and affections have not changed.&nbsp; Melissa continues to be picky when it comes to food. She will eat the same thing for 6 months and then she changes to something else. She is still fascinated by electronics and enjoys certain TV episodes that she can watch over and over again. When she speaks, she makes strong eye contact and she loves hugs, kisses, and any sort of physical contact from her loved ones. I’ve even seen her blow kisses to boys.</p><p>Melissa is my world and I hope that her medical team and I can help her through this difficult time in her life. She has endured so much in her 15 years of life thus far.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>For more detail on Melissa's incredible journey, </em><a href=\"https://www.syngapresearchfund.org/post/melissas-story\" target=\"_blank\"><em>read this remarkable account by her mother</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Melody is for the most part, good natured and easy going. She has been walking for a year now and has enjoyed the mobility. Although, her endurance and balance is still not great. Luckily she loves riding in her wheelchair! Some of Melody’s favorite things include animals (especially dogs), pb&amp;j sandwiches, water, and snuggles. In her 4 years of life she has already endured X-rays, MRI’s, blood draws, and countless hours of therapy. The areas we struggle with is Melody’s lack of communication skills (she is nonverbal) and sleeping. We currently are working on just the right dose of medications to help with her sleeping. Getting the diagnosis of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/syngap1/\">#syngap1</a> in September of last year, was an answer to our prayer as we were able to put a name to her developmental delays.

Michael does not functionally communicate, but uses echolalia and repetitive phrases from his favorite movies to socialize. For receptive language, I use Boardmaker Icons and Teacch Strategies through visual schedules, mini-schedules and routines to provide him with information and direction. I also use written lists and drawings to communicate with Michael and Michael writes and draws to express himself.</p><p>Michael is a beloved son, brother, cousin, grandson, nephew and uncle. His early life was not easy for him, nor was it easy for us trying to figure out how to help him, especially with his aggression. At six-foot, one-inch and 205 pounds, he was challenging. Today his aggression has decreased substantially, he still has 20-30 Atonic seizures daily (40-50 on a bad day), 2-4 drop seizures a week. All of these still even with three anti-seizure medications and a Vagus Nerve Stimulator.</p><p>‍<br>- Mom</p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Michael (age 6) from Hong Kong is a happy, loving and sensitive little boy. He loves playing with water, listening to music, watching trains and carousels and reading books, especially Toy Story.&nbsp; Behind those big blue eyes and beaming smile is a little boy that has had struggles since birth. Every milestone, that most of us take for granted, has been difficult for him and has been delayed but he continues his best.</p><p>Looking back, I noticed signs that something wasn’t right from the day he was born. Michael is our first child. Born three weeks early at 5.9 pounds we had no idea and everything was a learning experience for us, we had no other comparable sibling. In the first few days I struggled to breastfeed and get Michael to latch. Even with the help of nurses it was a struggle and like many mothers I blamed myself that I didn’t have enough milk and got myself quite stressed over it. Soon I realized it was important for my tiny baby to get milk so after spending 6 weeks pumping and completely tiring myself out, I decided to use formula. Once again, Michael didn’t take to any formula and a lot of the time he would spit up his milk. Later, our pediatrician recommended that we put him on a lactose free formula. It was slightly better but still he would spit up.&nbsp;</p><p>Another thing I had noticed and which surprised my husband and I was when he had his first vaccinations. I recall for his bilirubin test, the doctor pricked his heel and he didn’t even squeal. I found this extremely strange in a baby and the doctors didn’t say anything about it but I now know this is a symptom of his condition and that Syngapians have a high pain threshold.&nbsp;</p><p>After one day from being discharged from hospital, Michael had severe jaundice and was admitted again for another 3 days. He was put on a drip and a doctor had told us later that this could be a reason for his condition but after a brain scan, that soon got ruled out. Few months later he was admitted again with breathing issues which were diagnosed as bronchiolitis which we found ourselves in and out of hospital with over the next few years. Luckily, as he has grown, his episodes have become less and less and his immune system seems to have gotten much stronger.&nbsp;</p><p>As months went by more signs became apparent. Just the way he would hold his bottle with his fists and not clasp it with his fingers. He never put any toys in his mouth like other babies. Whilst I consistently raised this to the pediatrician, I was told not to worry and thankful he isn’t picking up germs. Deep down I knew this wasn’t right as babies explore through sensory activity. At some of the baby groups I took him too, he would spend the entire session crying until I took him out because of the noise of other babies. He hated being in a room of a big gathering especially if it was noisy.&nbsp;</p><p>At 6 months onwards when I started to put Michael on solids, this was another difficulty. He wouldn’t chew anything and I was too afraid so would just puree all his food. I felt it wasn’t helping him but at the same time I was too scared he would choke.</p><p>When Michael was 18 months, still not walking, a speech therapist I had consulted had recommended getting his ears and eyes checked. She thought if he had trouble seeing properly or issues with his ears, may be the reason why he is unable to walk. Surprisingly, the week he got his new glasses, he started to walk. Whilst he was still very unsteady on his feet it was a start and a new freedom for him.&nbsp; As time went by, he started to get stronger. He used to love running around by the waterfalls close to where we live and trying to dip his little hand under them. Even today, he loves being in or around water and is a great soother for Michael when he is stressed.</p><p>Around this time, our pediatrician agreed that he wasn’t developing at the rate usual for a child of his age and referred us to a developmental pediatrician.&nbsp; On seeing Michael, she immediately recommended we get Michael into occupational therapy and physiotherapy.&nbsp; At the time speech wasn’t really discussed because a previous speech therapist had told us that children would usually develop their gross and fine motor skills first. In hindsight, we probably should have started speech therapy earlier.</p><p>Separately, we started to notice jerk movements in Michael. They wouldn’t last more than a second and were generally set off when he ate or drank or had a bath. One time when we were seeing the developmental pediatrician, she noticed something that she called a drop attack. We just thought he fell as he was unsteady on his feet but she thought it was worth a referral to a neurologist and to have a brain scan. Michaels brain scan had come back clear, however, the neurologist had recommended an EEG and that’s when they advised that they think he may have epilepsy. The neurologist had pointed out that it wasn’t conclusive but she thought he should start a dose of Epilim. We didn’t want to put Michael onto more medication given they were only 50% sure that he had epilepsy as well as the fact he was already on Beclazone three times a day for his bronchiolitis. Therefore, we took his results to another neurologist for a second opinion and he confirmed he had epilepsy and if we didn’t start giving him the medication, it could lead to a large seizure. Luckily, Michael has always been on a very small dosage of Epilim as he has only ever had myoclonic seizures.&nbsp;</p><p>However, with everything we were uncovering, we were still baffled by his milestone delays and thus we had a genetic test done which zoomed into a particular gene which is highly related to learning ability, MED13.&nbsp;</p><p>Around the same time, post the suggestion from a speech therapist, we consulted some doctors at Great Ormond Street for a multi-disciplinary assessment for Michael. The doctor we saw, who has 35 year’s experience in neuro developmental pediatrics, was very certain that he would be able to provide a diagnosis. He agreed Michael has autistic tendencies but like our developmental pediatrician, he didn’t think autism was the primary cause. We were sure this would get us to the bottom of his condition and therefore, we decided to do the assessment. Four months later we spent a week back in the UK at Great Ormond Street hospital seeing various specialists including speech and occupational therapist, psychiatrist, neurologists, geneticist, you name it. It was intense and whilst stressful, we were looking forward to getting a diagnosis at the end of the week so we can start treatment for whatever it was. The geneticist reviewed the results of the test we had done previously. He confirmed that the MED13 mutation that Michael had was a de Nuovo and he said it could relate to a number of syndromes such as Fragile X or Angelman but there were other features within these syndromes that didn’t fit the bill with Michael. Unfortunately, no real conclusion came out of the assessment and all they could put it down to was global development delay. The geneticist we saw said we could get full gene testing done but it would be highly expensive and the treatment would most likely be the same as we are giving now anyway. At the time, we decided not to take it any further.&nbsp;</p><p>When Michael was a baby, he was an excellent sleeper. However, as he got older, he would wake in the middle of the night and as we would say, have a party in his room. He could be up for hours at a time and some days be totally wiped out in the morning. Even today, Michael will wake up in the night but now he would just run into our room and sleep with us but still continues to wake up early in the morning. Back in mid 2020, we decided to have a follow up with his neurologist due to his increased sleep disturbances and the jerk movements were becoming more frequent. We had a conversation with her and she referred us back to the neurologist at the public hospital and we discussed with him about doing the full genome testing. It had always been in our mind but this time we felt this was the last resort and if we didn’t get a diagnosis through this then we will never know. Additionally, given Michael is at the school age, we thought getting a diagnosis would also help and better place him for any special needs school if/when required. In all honesty, if Michael could speak, we probably wouldn’t have taken this route and life would have continued believing he just had Global Development delay.&nbsp;</p><p>Three months ago, Michael was diagnosed with SynGAP1. Whilst it is still a shock to hear your child has such a terrible disorder, it was a relief to finally get an answer to something we have been searching for years for. At least we knew the treatment we were getting for Michael such as ABA therapy, occupational and speech therapy was the right path. However, what the diagnosis has allowed is for us to connect with other families through the Syngap Global family network and the Syngap Research Fund. Whilst we are relatively new to this group, we have already found it an excellent source of information. We are obviously concerned for Michaels future but are hopeful that there will be breakthroughs that will help our children with SynGap1. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Nathan, will be 4 years old in June 2021. Since he was born, he has been a sweet, observant, and happy boy – his whole face lights up when he smiles, and his laugh is adorably contagious! We saw early on that he was missing milestones but it wasn’t until we introduced baby food when he was 6-8 months old that we realized he had trouble swallowing. This was our first real indication that something was wrong. Since then, we have been tirelessly trying to figure out what made Nathan different. </p><p>Shortly after we entered our 2020 national lockdown my husband and I noticed Nathan would occasionally blink/roll his eyes back when he ate. It would happen so quickly and infrequently that I wasn’t able to catch it on video until August 2020 – by this time it was occurring a little more frequently. An EEG revealed that this was in fact epileptic activity. A genetic test was run for epilepsy-specific mutations and on December 15th we learned that Nathan has SynGap1. As we read about its presentations, we realized that Nathan had been displaying nearly every marker for SynGAP1 since he was 6 months old, but due to its rarity and relative recent discovery, wasn’t diagnosed (there are fewer than 800 diagnosed SynGAP1 patients worldwide as of March 2021). </p><p>Because of Nathan’s difficulty swallowing, he has been receiving feeding therapy since he was about eight months old. That quickly led to speech therapy since his muscles weren’t strong enough to perform the tasks they should. Physical therapy and occupational therapy were added due to his global developmental delays, low muscle tone and missing milestones. He has about 80 words but no consistent phrases. He is very attentive and understands so much more than we realize. He follows simple commands, even when asked to do things he’s not been asked before. True of other Syngapians, Nathan loves anything to do with water and escaping. We have found him fully clothed in the bathtub and shower and he has escaped the house into the backyard many times via our Great Dane-sized dog door!</p><p>My hope is that Nathan’s diagnosis informs more providers (and people in general) of SynGAP. I also hope that my advocacy for and dedication to providing the best care for Nathan not only raises awareness, but money for research for this and other rare diseases – both from private donors and governments. </p><p>As a newly diagnosed family, the hardest part of a SynGap diagnosis is mourning the life you thought your child would lead. Once you realize that you are not alone in this journey – SRF is a huge support for us – and that there are gains to be made for your child despite how hard everything is, you will find the strength to do whatever you can possibly do to support your child. I am excited by the pace of medical advancement and am confident we will see benefits for all of our children soon.</p><p><br></p><p><br><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>My name is Nick Punt and I am from the Netherlands. Together with my twin brother, Lars Punt, we call ourselves the Syngap Twins. I am 3.5 years old and from the age of 1.5 we knew we had Syngap1. I have also been diagnosed with epilepsy. Unfortunately, epilepsy is not yet completely under control. This is probably because I had a cerebral infarction during pregnancy. Because of the medication I get fewer absences (with myoclonische characteristics), but i have still 10 absences in a day. According to my mom and dad I am a happy boy. Together we have a lot of fun. But occasionally my parents doesn't understand me. Maybe it’s because I cannot speak yet and that makes communication very difficult. I also have a very nice wheelchair, an adapted chair and a high low bed. These tools help me to develop further in the right way. My mum and dad are working on adapting our house so that I can be cared for even better. Last year I didn't have to go to the hospital anymore. Occasionally I don't like the food and for that I had to go to the hospital regularly. Eventually they gave me a PEG probe so that I can eat whenever I want and if I don't want I get my food through the PEG. Then I still get enough food, which makes me less likely to fall ill.</p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>My name is James Patrick Jordan. I have epilepsy. It will not stop me. I enjoy special olympics (basketball, flag football, and track), school, church, college football and basketball, collecting college mascots, video games, and Pokemon Go.” When asked what he would want other kids who have disabilities to know he said, “with disabilities you are different from others. It is okay, it makes you special.”</p><p>In April of 2020 after his first grand mal seizure, Patrick was diagnosed with Syngap1. After over 15 years of searching, I’m still wrapping my head around the fact we finally have an answer.</p><p>Patrick is a warrior in every sense. He is truly the bravest and toughest person I know. He has a pure soul, a huge heart, and loves to help others. He is persistent, stubborn, and strong willed. Patrick loves sports and tries hard at everything he does and is a team payer who absolutely LOVES being part of a team.</p><p>From the start he has been our puzzle. For the longest time he needed much less sleep than the rest of us. He had chronic ear infections, delayed sitting, walking, and talking. Delayed enough for us to sense something was not right - but not enough to raise a red flag with doctors.</p><p>At 3.5, Patrick was diagnosed with epilepsy. He spent several days in the hospital, followed by months of testing - nothing was found. He was later diagnosed with Dyspraxia, Expressive/Receptive Language disorder, and ADHD. Thankfully his seizures were mostly very mild, hardly noticeable.</p><p>With this diagnosis we now have an answer to our questions and a sense of community.</p><p>Patrick is a junior in the Floral and Horticulture Program at our local career center. Last year, his Special Olympics basketball team was state runner up in their division (he was recognized with a varsity letter from school!). Patrick played the trombone all through middle school and marched in the band freshman year of high school. He is not afraid of anything, Patrick gives me incredible hope.<br></p>"

Today he can run, ride his tricycle, ski and ride horses.</p><p>He is potty trained and no longer wears diapers for 6 months now. He loves drawing, looking at books but his favorite is to watch cartoons, especially Paw Patrol, Peppa Pig and Scoobidoo and Youtube on the Ipad. He can say a few words and also begins to read basic words. He mainly communicates using signed Makaton, also practiced at his Institute.</p><p>Despite a few absence seizures, he is not receiving any treatment for epilepsy.</p><p>Paul has a hard time managing his frustrations and transitions can be difficult. He gets mad easily (sometimes with aggressive behaviors toward us) and depending on the situation, he can be difficult to control. After his crisis, he feels bad and come to us for forgiveness because Paul loves hugs and kisses (giving and receiving). He can also have obsessions (at the moment he loves watching &nbsp;automatic parking gates videos on youtube). Paul is very loving and determined to keep making progress and the difficult moments are easily forgotten.”</p><p>‍</p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Around age 2, we knew something was going on with our little Payton. She wasn't talking as much as her sister. We always called her our quiet child. It took her almost 17 months to walk. We started looking into tests and procedures to uncover what's going on with Payton. Around 3 years old, an EEG revealed she was having seizures. Which broke our hearts. Many more tests were done all of which uncovered nothing. Until October 2014 (age 6), when we got a call from metabolic indicating they found what Payton has, #Syngap1! This was hard to hear, but in the same breath, we had a label; an answer as to what is going on with Payton. How does this affect her? She is slower than most children her age. She has apraxia of speech, so she doesn't talk smooth like everyone else. She has to stop and think about what she wants to say. Payton is like a drunken sailor. She is off balance either due to her medication or her condition. She has low muscle tone and has many accidents and falls from time to time. She works hard to fit in and wants to be accepted. She is loved by many and her smile lights up the room. She has amazing determination to try hard and stubbornness to be independent. Currently she is participating in karate and ballet. She seems to enjoy both. We love her for everything she does and is and wouldn't change anything other than this genetic mutation. If we could give her anything in life, it would be to have all the abilities that the rest of us have. The ability not to allow seizures to intrude on her capacity to learn and grow. The power to increase her intelligence and grow up and have a career and a family and to be loved and appreciated and give back to the world in a way that she would enjoy. I pray that continued research finds solutions to help us find the normal button.</p><p>- The Durrett Family, Finding the Normal Button<br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Preston lives in a small-town in central Pennsylvania, and was first diagnosed with SYNGAP1 in January of 2021. &nbsp;Getting a diagnosis for Preston was surprising to say the least, however, the SYNGAP1 diagnosis finally explained all of Preston’s symptoms. &nbsp;Previous to the SYNGAP1 diagnosis he was diagnosed with Autism in August of 2020, he was also diagnosed with Epilepsy in October of 2020. &nbsp;Currently, Preston is 3 years 1 month. He has been able to walk since Christmas Eve of 2019, which was a huge milestone for him to overcome. &nbsp;Preston currently receives Occupational Therapy, Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy, Vision Therapy, and has a teacher come to his home one time per week.</p><p> </p><p>He continues to work on his speech skills, as he is currently n0n-verbal, however, he is excellent at showing us what he wants. &nbsp;We continue to work with medications to get his seizures under control, as this seems to be a battle we are always fighting. &nbsp;Lastly, Preston still refuses to eat any type of solid foods. &nbsp;He currently eats purees from a bottle. &nbsp;We continue to see our feeding team in hopes of getting better results.</p><p> </p><p>Overall, Preston has had a hard-uphill battle during toddlerhood, as most children with SYNGAP1 do. &nbsp;However, he remains kind, loving, and full of life. &nbsp;He loves to snuggle, be held, play outdoors, swing, play in water, and play with anything with lights or music. &nbsp;Each day Preston, as I am sure most of our children do, wakes up with determination, and resilience to learning. &nbsp;Some days I am simply astounded by his daily determination.</p><p><br><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>At 9 months we noticed Reuben was not hitting his childhood milestones. He struggled to sit up and feeding was an issue. We saw many professionals over years and Reuben had MRI scans, many blood tests, Lumbar punctures, initial genetic screening tests and other procedures but these didn’t give us any answers to his development delays. In 2014 we were entered into the UK DDD (Deciphering Developmental Disorders) study and 18 months later Reuben was diagnosed in 2016 (aged 4.5) with SYNGAP1.</p><p>Reuben has a mutation in SYNGAP 1 which has caused him to have an intellectual disability, global developmental delay, autism, behavioural abnormalities, hypertonia, impaired language development and sleep issues. Reuben has some words but mainly communicates through his Makaton and his PECS.</p><p>Like most children with SYNGAP1 Reuben loves water, animals especially horses, goats, cows, sensory activities and has the most infectious laugh and giggle. Reuben loves music and has brilliant rhythm, he enjoys dancing to his favourite songs.&nbsp; He is a thrill seeker which we discovered recently, he signs more when the rollercoaster stops!</p><p>Some days are quite challenging as Reuben gets very frustrated and lashes out at us and others too. He struggles with transiting from his favourite places and thrives on routine. He has no danger awareness and is very strong willed and determined.</p><p>We are truly blessed to have him in our lives and he brings happiness in so many ways. He has made us see things in a new way, taught us so much and is our little hero who has overcome so such. He continues to make us proud every day with new milestones and achievements.<br></p>"

He loves to be outside, just roaming around. Music, singing, and instruments are mesmerizing for him. Ricky loves to watch The Voice, American Idol, and Little Baby Bum is his most favorite. </p><p>He has most recently learned what his head is thanks to Cocomelon and can point to it and say \"heee\", which has given us hope that he may be able to speak one day. He’s a very energetic, playful, loving, hilarious little dude. </p><p>Ricky is a routine baby and we rely on it heavily, but lately we’ve been trying to try new things like going to eat at a restaurant (sometimes it goes well and sometimes it doesn’t, but practice makes perfect, and Netflix helps). Ricky also has an unrelated mutation in his slc26A4 that caused bilateral hearing loss. We live in a small town with very little resources or inclusivity, but we’ve done what we can to educate and have been lucky enough to find childcare who care for him as best they can, and he has a family full of love and support behind him.</p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Ryan was diagnosed with Syngap1 in November of 2020 at UMC Utrecht. We stopped searching for a cause years ago, but insurance wise it was logical to do exome&nbsp; sequencing once more before his 18th birthday. Bingo.</p><p>He was born healthy (we thought) in 2003. After 6 months we noticed that he was not developing at the usual rate. At 11 months, we had a “circus” of tests done, no cause was found. He was diagnosed with global developmental delay. At 2.5 years, he just started walking but we noticed that he fell a lot. An EEG was done and showed that Ryan was having seizures, thus an epilepsy diagnosis. At this point we started experimenting with one drug after another, alternative methods, and finally at the age of 4 we started the ketogenic diet and he became 100% seizure free. I thought we won the battle.</p><p>Ryan started at a special needs school but we were advised that he would do better elsewhere. At this time his frustration was growing, not being able to communicate led to aggression (biting, scratching, and hair pulling). After much research we found ABA. At the time ABA was not a big thing in Holland (still isn’t). But I found one ABA school in another part of Holland. We sold our house, found new jobs and moved there. After 18 months his seizures came back and he had a prolonged QT interval of his heart, a rare side effect of the diet. Ryan then had a NVS implanted and we tried CBD oil - all in which did not work for him. We no longer have tried to treat his epilepsy. Eventually Ryan faded out of his ABA school so we transitioned him to a special needs school in the area in which he is thriving.</p><p>He has about everything on the Syngap1 list: constant epileptic activity, autism, sleepless nights, dyspraxia, teeth grinding, and aggressive behaviors. Ryan is extremely determined. When it is his will against yours, you will lose. Punishment never works. Positive bribery does. Mentally he is like a 2 year old. With years and years of ABA, horse therapy, music therapy, aquatherapy, speech therapy, dolphin therapy we have reached wonders behavioral wise. Often he is still very aggressive, which can be difficult due to his size.</p><p>Fortunately, most of the time he is easy to handle. He is the happiest kid I know. Very affectionate with family, most of all with his 16 year old brother William. Because he is happy and laughs a lot, people always&nbsp; instantly fall in love with him.</p><p>The last five years we mainly focus on behavior, following instructions and flexibility. He understands simple instructions and knows some sign language to tell us what he wants.&nbsp; We have a great team of aids working with him. They also come along on family holidays.</p><p>Ryan loves exciting things: fire, thunder and lightning, heavy rain, roller coasters. He isn’t afraid of anything. Only of barking dogs. The minute he sees a dog he puts his hands over his ears and starts panicking. But he loves dogs as well. He also loves sea lions, goats, and horses. It is pretty amazing to see how he connects with these animals.<br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Ryker is 9 years old and is the youngest of three boys. He suffers from Absence and Eyelid Myoclonia Seizures. Ryker is non-verbal and didn't walk till he was 3 years old. Now you can't stop him. He loves to go, go, go!&nbsp;</p><p>Ryker's birth was different compared to his two older brothers. Ryker came out not breathing and purple. They swept him off to NICU and later brought him back to us once he was stabilized. They informed us all was well and he was a healthy baby boy. When getting discharged I informed the Pediatric Hospitalist that Ryker didn't cry once throughout the night and I was concerned. The physician shushed me and said, \"You should be thankful for a quiet baby.\" For the next 9 months at Ryker's Well Child check-ups I expressed concern to our family physician that Ryker wasn't meeting his milestones like his brothers did. Again, they reassured me that Ryker was healthy and that I shouldn't compare kids. Finally at Ryker's 9 month Well-child check I expressed I was not comfortable with their answers and requested they refer us to a specialist to prove me wrong.&nbsp; The specialist informed me he was cognitive of a 1 month old and his fine and gross motor skills were of a 3 month old. Even though the news was crushing, we immediately met with a neurologist and geneticist. For the next 4.5 years we did rounds of genetic testing only to get the same answer - all was normal. It wasn't until we requested the Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) that we finally received his diagnosis of SYNGAP1 when he was 4.5 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>From 3-6 years old we struggled with severe behavioral and sensory issues. Which resulted in self-injury behaviors or attacking the person closest to him. This was a daily event, With ABA Therapy and proper medication we were eventually able to minimize his meltdowns. His meltdowns now are usually triggered only by sensory.</p><p>Ryker uses a communication device to communicate. He continues to work hard at his weekly therapies and is currently working on jumping, so he can jump into the pool this summer!&nbsp;</p><p>Ryker is a smiley kid and loves all things water! He loves elevators, automatic doors, lights and currently curtains blowing. He has a funny sense of humor with some sarcasm and keeps his family and teachers on their toes. Ryker attends a regular public school that is K-8. He's Mr. Popular at school and knows it. He loves snuggles, tickle time with Dad and wrestling with his older brothers.</p><p>We are thankful for finding our second family in the SynGAP community through SRF.<br></p>"

His APGAR scores were 8/8. He was breast-fed and then added in formula and some solid food such as baby Gerber rice around&nbsp; 5 months. It was around 6 months that our pediatrician was concerned that Shaan was not meeting his gross-motor milestones such as rolling over and sitting up properly. He wasn't really making eye contact, not babbling consonants, etc.. Around age 1, we enrolled Shaan in early intervention and had a panel of genetic testing, all which came back negative. His MRI also came back normal.&nbsp; Our neurologist diagnosed him as PDD-NOS and which allowed us to enrolled Shaan in our town's special needs program.</p><p>Currently, as a 15 year old Shaan is nonverbal with some gross-motor delays and overall hypotonia. He can walk, run not really jump or skip. He communicates basic needs with an I-pad using Apple's Proloquel. As of now, he has&nbsp; not had a seizure that we are aware of and we do look for the staring seizures as well. He loves to swim, go for walks, go for car rides, and spin on the floor. He is a picky eater and is short and thin for his age. He sleeps through the night and is extremely grouchy in the morning. He is very sensory seeking and craves deep pressure and high rigorous movements like swings. He functions with repetition, praise and verbal behavior with gestural prompts. In addition to us as caretakers, he has his 12 year old brother 2 other routine sitters.</p><p><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Simón lives with his sister, father, and mother. When he was 6 months old he was diagnosed with low tone and a global developmental delay. He started to walk at 2 years old and since then, he has been in Occupational, Speech, and Physical Therapy. After almost 9 years of countless exams (EEGs, genetic tests, and MRI’s) he got the Syngap1 diagnosis.</p><p>Nowadays he goes to a specialized center to get individual comprehensive therapies. Simón has made slow progress, although he has no verbal language (he only says Dad, Mom, and Tata to his sister), he understands everything and is very persuasive. He makes himself understood through signs and gestures. Simón has no diagnosis of epilepsy. However, his fine motor skills are poorly developed and he has difficulties with attention. He walks, runs, moves easily, eats and sleeps very well.</p><p>Simón is a like a box of surpirses. He is cheerful, tender, and happy, however, he has a low tolerance for frustration when he is denied access. Thus, he can be self-aggressive, hitting himself on the head and loud screaming.</p><p>He loves music, animals, horseback riding, going to the movies, parties, swimming, anything technological, and playing puppets.</p><p>Simón is our reason for being and worth fighting for. The whole family revolves around his well-being, progress, and happiness.</p><p><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Sofia was diagnosed with a SYNGAP11 mutation at the age of 10. She is an amazing young girl who has a heart of gold and could not be a more loving person. Sofia is kind and caring, laid back and has an amazing sense of humor. She really enjoys watching movies, going shopping and dining in her favorite restaurants. Sofia is very feminine and is keen to make sure she dresses nice and looks cute. She deals every day with many difficulties due to her limited cognition, decreased motor skills and challenging behaviors. Despite all this however, she manages to stay very happy. She is our hero. Therapy has always been very helpful for her. In particular, ABA therapy has been very important in helping her by focusing on her most significant challenge, her behavior. Deep down inside we know that Sofia wants to help heal that brain of hers so that she would be able to have more clear thoughts and process things clearly. This would help her more easily connect with people and the world around her.<br>We realize that the only hope in finding appropriate treatments and a potential cure is through more significant and much-needed research in Syngap. Increased public awareness and education will be important in bringing more attention to this critical illness.</p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Stanley was born a happy and healthy little boy. It was not until he was about 8 months old and then he slowly started missing his milestones. At 18 months old we had a diagnosis of hypermobility and then slowly learnt of many other delays and at 3 years and 3 months came an autism diagnosis. In early 2019, we finally received the Syngap1 diagnosis when Stanley was 5 years old. The reason behind all of his delays.</p><p>Stanley attends a fantastic specialist provision school and is slowly making progress in all areas. He is non verbal and uses makaton sign mainly for communication.</p><p>His main struggles are transitions, obsessive behaviours and sleep problems. He can become anxious and frustrated which can result in aggressive behaviours. (Only really towards his parents and brother). Despite the challenges he faces Stanley is mostly a very happy and very loving little boy. He loves balloons and aeroplanes and anything that flies! He has a great sense of humour and an infections laugh. We work hard to support Stanley and are very fortunate to have great family and friends supporting us.

    "Full Story": "<p>Steven was diagnosed at 15 months old (May 12, 2020) with SynGAP1 mutation after getting whole exome sequencing at the beginning of the year following a normal MRI. &nbsp; Steven has global developmental delays including delayed gross motor, fine motor, language and learning skills.&nbsp; He has oral aversions and difficulty swallowing.&nbsp; He also has extreme difficulties sleeping at night.&nbsp; He does not sleep more than 4-5 hours a night and sometimes he can have a lot of difficulty falling asleep to take a nap.</p><p>Steven loves water, animals and being outside—he loves going outside no matter the time of day or night! Bath time, swimming, splashing in the soapy dish water are all so much fun for Steven. He is a lucky boy and has two cats and two dogs in his house and he will vocalize at them and loves pushing his forehead into them to show them love.&nbsp; He is overly sensitive to the wind though and will often have an exaggerated reflex to the feel of the wind on his skin.</p><p>He is very social and can be quite loud when he gets excited.&nbsp; His smile spreads from cheek to cheek. Steven does not have words yet, but he does make several sounds to indicate his many emotions. One of his special Syngapian powers is his ability to communicate with just a look.</p><p>Steven’s absolute favorite person is his older brother Tyler. Tyler and Steven love to play peek-a-boo. Steven learned to stand from using the couch to look for his brother during the games they played together.</p><p>Steven is starting taking a few independent steps on his own. He is not quite walking, but our hope is with time, will walk on his own one day.&nbsp; This is a huge milestone for us.</p><p>He teaches us everyday about unconditional love, patience, and seeing the world through his eyes.&nbsp; He is perfect just like his brother and together they are going to change the world (hopefully they won’t set it on fire, because they can be thick as thieves sometimes and I wonder what kind of mischief is coming).</p><p> - Mom</p><p>Learn more about Steven in these articles by his mom.

    "Full Story": "<p>Tarik was born in Tuzla and was born healthy. He cried a lot as a baby and eventually was diagnosed with torticollis, and it was corrected with physical therapy. Quickly, we realized he was not meeting his milestones. Started walking and his first word both happened at the age of 2. He still has very minimal language.</p><p>Tarik was diagnosed with Syngap1 in December of 2019 (in Barcelona). He does not suffer from epilepsy or sleep issues. Tarik does have many traits of autism but has not had a diagnosis.</p><p>Occupational and Speech Therapy have greatly helped Tarik. We have even tried using a hyperbaric chamber.</p><p>Tarik has no sense of fear, which means he requires constant supervision. He can become very upset when he is misunderstood and gets aggressive with those around him. Tarik does not like school, so we are hoping to find a better fit for him someday. As he has grown older, he has become very difficult to manage as he has aggressive outbursts. As of now it is relatively controlled with the help of medication.</p><p>He loves music and animals. Swimming and going for long walks are some of the activities he greatly enjoys. Loves watching rhyming videos! He has a good memory; he remembers people and names, as well as symbols.</p><p>In Bosnia, life is difficult, but with a sick child it is even worse. We hope to be able to somehow move to Germany, where the conditions for Tarik will be better. Tarik is the center of our world and my husband and I will devote our lives to him alone.</p><p>Best regards from beautiful Bosnia and Herzegovina. I wish all of us a lot of positive energy, strength, and health to fight through life.<br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Tommy is our SynGAP warrior who was finally diagnosed in October 2017 after a very comprehensive and extensive medical workup. He has a splice mutation at Intron 13, epilepsy (primarily Lennox-Gestatut patten). We have seen at least 5 different types of seizures, tried multiple AED medications and various combinations and have settled on Lamictal, Tripeptal and Topamax. He is very limited in his expressive language, has bowel issues, global cognitive developmental delays that were first noticed at 4 months old. We currently have him in a fabulous autism school program, in-home support, and recently added ABA therapy as behavioral issues and outbursts have become more significant. Tommy has an infectious smile, loves ‘warm fuzzy’ attention and his big brother (26) ia a hands down favorite. He also has a 23 year old sister. Some of his favorite activities are watching and cheering at high school sporting events, chuck-e-cheese and bowling in a special league and going out on our boat hoping to see \"ales\", also known as dolphins. His other favorite is a collection of lawn chairs and I mean about 30. He enjoys looking at pictures and youtube videos. He is very social and active in our community of Chesapeake. From what I know he is the only diagnosed Syngapian locally. He brings our family so much joy, despite the challenges and he has taught me patience and adaptability. I love him with all my heart. I like to say I live with Superman!</p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Tyler is sweet, vibrant and mischievous. He was diagnosed with Syngap1 when he was 16 months old. Tyler is always happy and his smile is contagious. He loves water, music, lights, fire trucks, food, big hugs and making his siblings laugh. Ty works hard every day at therapy to achieve milestones that come naturally to most kids. His biggest challenge is speech. He knows what he wants to say but doesn't have the motor planning skills to say it properly. Tyler is making progress at his own pace and is teaching us to take it one day at a time, to appreciate the simple things and to celebrate every milestone. We are proud of him, Tyler is our Syngap Warrior and our hope is that other people can see past the disability and discover what an amazing human being he is.</p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>His name means full of life. If you ask any parent, they will always say that their child is the most amazing human on this planet. However, we say this with pride and conviction as we have seen Vivaan fight against any complications thrown at him.</p><p>We learned about his condition in January 2018, and what an emotional journey it has been for all of us. Vivaan had to go through a series of blood tests, EEG sessions, and also a very painful CSF test for the doctors to find out that he has SynGap1. All throughout his tests and doctors' appointments, he used to be calm, cheerful, and full of life; like his name suggests.</p><p>He struggles with his speech but with continuous speech and occupational therapies, Vivaan can say at least 25-30 words now and has also started to try saying new words (not clearly) by himself. We have noticed that with repetition in different activities, he can understand and learn a lot of things. He has excellent problem-solving skills and can communicate his likes/dislikes to us with actions and signs.</p><p>Our biggest worry is what will happen to him when we're gone? Today we are here to take care of each and every little necessity of his, but we will grow old and there will come a time when we won't be there to do anything for him. Due to this concern, our goal is make Vivaan as capable as his condition can let him be and live in this world with a happy heart and smile on his face.</p><p> - Mom</p><p><br></p>"

    "Full Story": "<p>Will is a 9-year-old boy who was diagnosed with Syngap1 when he was 6 years old. It was noticed he wasn't developing normally around age 12 months. He had no spoken words and was not attempting to walk at all; was barely crawling. Will remains nonverbal. He is very vocal, however, and I believe he has a lot he would like to say. Will uses a speech generating device and goes to an amazing school where he is encouraged to communicate all day long with it. Will has been in various therapies since he was 18 months old including speech, occupational, physical, and behavior therapies. He has a seizure disorder which includes atypical absence and atonic seizures. He had many drops as a toddler from the atonic seizures and has had stitches and staples in his head, loss of nerve function resulting in a gray front tooth which thankfully came in white as a permanent tooth, as well as a fractured clavicle. He eventually got a protective helmet which helped with head injuries. Will has tried many seizure meds and has never been fully controlled. He had a vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) implanted when he was 4. After that it felt like we experienced a miracle. His drop seizures seemed to have been cured. He still takes two heavy seizure meds as well and we see occasional breakthrough absence seizures. Will has aggressive behaviors when denied access to what he wants. He also doesn't understand danger and is a very fast runner who doesn't normally listen when told to stop. Will is an extremely-active child and rarely will you see him not moving. He loves playing basketball, climbing stairs, watching ceiling fans, and opening and closing doors. He is also very affectionate and loves the people in his life. He has a fun-loving personality and you can't help but enjoy his genuine happiness.<br></p>"
